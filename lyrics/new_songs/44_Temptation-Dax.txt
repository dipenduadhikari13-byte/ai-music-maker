Temptation's outside knockin' at my door
I won the battle last night, but I'm still at war
I starve my flesh and feed my spirit with faith
Then raise hell 'til it's up at Heaven's gates

Temptation creeps into an idle mind
Lack of purpose is the place, seekin' pleasure resides
And feels safe (and gets its strength)
Uh, temptation loves fame, serves ego and pride
Mama told me, "Two wrongs don't make no right"
So I pray (the temptation away)

Temptation makes slaves out of lustful eyes (out of lustful eyes)
It'll rob you of your happiness and pay you attention with lies (with lies, attention)
In that darkness, you'll find shame's not worth your time (it's not worth your time)
Then appraise your sin for the cost of peace of mind (oh, yeah)

Temptation creeps into an idle mind
Lack of purpose is the place, seekin' pleasure resides
And feels safe (and gets its strength)
Uh, temptation loves fame, serves ego and pride
Mama told me, "Two wrongs don't make no right"
So I pray (the temptation away)

Down by the river dale
In the garden where the snake tempted Adam and Eve
They ate the fruit
And from those seeds grew the roots of this family tree

It's why we struggle, it's why we fight
Our mother's nature, father time
The human race, but fall behind
Dyin' to live, but all livin' to die

For goodness' sake
We've been atone for sins and given God's grace
Stuck in this Babylonic world we can't escape
Goin' to war with demons every day
The soul and spirit break, that's why I pray

Temptation's outside, knockin' at my door (temptation's knockin' at my door)
I won the battle last night, but I'm still at war (I am still at war)
I starve my flesh and feed my spirit with faith (I will feed my spirit with faith)
And raise hell 'til it's up at Heaven's gates (I raise hell)
Down by the riverdale 'til it's up at heaven's gates
