Directions (68-74): Read the following passage and answer the given questions. 
A data breach may be analogously construed as an intramural foray transpiring under the shroud of 
nocturnal stillness, where an infiltrator, akin to a digital brigand, subtly _________________ with invaluable 
assets, leaving the homeowner oblivious until the irrevocable damage manifests. In congruence, corporate 
entities find themselves ensnared in the surreptitious siphoning or compromise of consequential data 
within the digital milieu. This pervasive quandary casts its ominous pall across a myriad of global 
enterprises, with an astounding 83% of scrutinized organizations contending with recurrent incursions, as 
delineated in the comprehensive 2022 Cost of Data Breach analysis proffered by IBM. 
Operationally, data breaches epitomize security conundrums culminating in the unauthorized 
manipulation, disclosure, access, or obliteration of personal data, opportunely exploiting systemic 
susceptibilities or misconfigurations. Cyber malefactors, be they individual agents or collective entities, 
deploy an eclectic array of stratagems—ranging from malware incursions to the subterfuge of phishing 
emails—enabling their ingress into corporate networks. In an epoch characterized by the ceaseless 
generation and utilization of data across sundry devices, systems, and applications, the peril of clandestine 
data access is exponentially exacerbated. 
The repercussions of data breaches transcend mere pecuniary ramifications, precipitating deleterious 
effects on an organization's reputational standing and instigating punitive measures from regulatory 
bodies. International jurisdictions, attuned to the burgeoning threat matrix, have responded by 
promulgating stringent data protection and privacy statutes, thereby endowing individuals with autonomy 
over their data and obligating corporate entities to assume augmented responsibilities. Consequently, 
organizational prioritization of preventative and responsive stratagems becomes imperative, cognizant of 
the exigency of compliance with dynamically evolving regulatory paradigms amidst the contemporaneous 
milieu of data proliferation and cyber-security vicissitudes. 
 
Q68. What aspect contribute to the potential for unauthorized access? 
(a) Utilizing data security systems exclusively for the primary device.  
(b) The continuous generation and utilization of data across diverse devices and applications. 
(c) The continuous creation and technological advancement of devices. 
(d) Collaborating with cyber malefactors, exposing all devices to vulnerabilities.  
(e) Corporations compromising consequential data within the digital milieu. 
 
Q69. Considering the prevalence of data across diverse domains, what are the potential 
consequences of failing to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access for businesses? 
(I) Businesses may suffer reputational damage due to breaches of trust and the perception that they cannot 
adequately protect sensitive data 
(II) Financial losses through theft, fraud, or the compromise of sensitive financial information. 
(III) A diminution in customer satisfaction resulting from the dissemination of data pertaining to a 
company's product. 
20 

 
(a) Only (I) 
(b) Only (II) 
(c) Both (I) and (II) 
(d) Both (I) and (III) 
(e) All (I), (II) and (III) 
 
Q70. Which of the following cannot be considered as a data breach in the realm of cyber threats? 
(a) Phishing attacks that trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.  
(b) Malware infections exploiting vulnerabilities to compromise computer systems. 
(c) Utilizing standard network monitoring tools to detect and address typical network issues. 
(d) Insider threats involving malicious actions or negligence from within an organization. 
(e) None of these
