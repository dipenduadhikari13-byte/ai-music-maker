Directions (75-80): Read the following passage and answer the questions. 
Voice or speaker recognition refers to a machine or program's ability to interpret dictation or understand 
and execute spoken commands. This technology has become increasingly prominent with the _____________ 
of artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligent assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Offering hands-
free interactions, voice recognition systems enable users to make requests, set reminders, and perform 
various tasks simply by speaking. 
The process involves automatic speech recognition (ASR) programs that can identify and differentiate 
voices. Some ASR programs necessitate users to train the system for improved accuracy in converting 
speech to text. Evaluation of a voice's frequency, accent, and speech flow is integral to voice recognition 
systems. 
While voice recognition and speech recognition are often used interchangeably, they have distinct 
meanings. Voice recognition identifies the speaker, whereas speech recognition assesses the content of 
what is said. 
In practice, voice recognition software on computers converts analog audio into digital signals through 
analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion. This digital database of words or syllables is then compared to signals 
during pattern recognition. The size of the program's effective vocabulary depends on the computer's RAM 
capacity, with faster processing speeds enhancing search capabilities. 
Voice recognition involves analyzing speech through models like the hidden Markov model or recurrent 
neural networks. The former breaks down spoken words into phonemes, while the latter uses previous 
outputs to influence current inputs, improving capabilities and accuracy with increased data. 
The integration of voice recognition into smartphones and home devices like Google Home and Amazon 
Echo has made this technology ubiquitous. As more users engage with voice recognition, the wealth of data 
generated enhances the capabilities and accuracy of these systems, indicating a promising trajectory for 
the technology's future. 
 
Q75. What is the specific focus of voice recognition in comparison to speech recognition? 
(a) Voice recognition predominantly centers on discerning the speaker's identity rather than appraising 
the uttered content. 
(b) Voice recognition deciphers the speaker's words and then correlates them with nearby speakers.  
(c) Speech recognition primarily concentrates on the speaker's tone, whereas voice recognition identifies 
the speaker's voice modulations. 
(d) The terms voice recognition and speech recognition are frequently used interchangeably, as they serve 
a similar purpose. 
(e) Voice recognition entails discerning the distinct acoustic modulations of the speaker, whereas speech 
recognition proffers lexical conjectures to the speaker. 
 
Q76. What is the function of pattern recognition as described in the passage in the context of voice 
recognition software? 
(a) Translating analog audio into digital signals 
(b) Recognizing the digital signals and subsequently converting them into analog signals for the system to 
comprehend the language. 
(c) Analyzing and comparing a digital repository of words derived from converting analog audio into digital 
signals 
(d) Evaluating the computer's RAM capacity to expedite the search for an effective vocabulary. 
(e) Both (a) and (c) 
22 

 
 
Q77. How does Markov model contribute to the overall improvement of voice recognition 
capabilities? 
(a) Incorporating and neglecting the preceding output to impact the input of the subsequent stage in voice 
recognition. 
(b) Utilizing phonemes for coarse identification of the origin of words and their association with the correct 
meaning. 
(c) Aggregating words into components to generate the output for the voice recognition process. 
(d) Dissection of words into phonetic components allows for a more granular analysis of voice recognition. 
(e) None of these 
 
Q78. Why does the passage suggest that the wealth of data is a crucial factor in determining the 
positive course of development for voice recognition technology? 
(a) The substantial amount of data will allow users to obtain authentic results of their search requests. 
(b) It will provide a diverse and extensive range of speech patterns, accents, and variations, enriching the 
system's database.  
(c) More users will be engaged to contribute to the wealth of data 
(d) It enhances the capabilities of voice recognition systems to accurately interpret and respond to a wide 
array of voices and linguistic nuances 
(e) Both (b) and (d) 
 
Q79. Choose the most suitable word that should fill the given blank. 
(a) advent 
(b) oblivious 
(c) conservation 
(d) adversity 
(e) mundane

(b) rationalize, progressed, exclusive
