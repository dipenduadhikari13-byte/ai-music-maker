The last few months have been great for the economy. New 
cases have fallen, and economic activity is racing back to 
pre-pandemic levels. After a c.24% contraction in the 
quarter ending June 2020, we expect GDP to grow by a 
positive 1.8% in the quarter ending December 2020. 
 
This is quite a sharp turnaround in a short period. A careful 
look suggests that a key driver of the rebound has been 
pent-up goods demand. As the lockdown ended, the 
production 
of 
consumer 
non-durables 
shot 
up,

household financial savings funded this rebound.
