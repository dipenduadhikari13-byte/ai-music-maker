Alas, we also find that goods demand is back at pre-
pandemic levels and may not be the key driver of a 
continued rebound. Thankfully, pent-up services demand 
can play that role. Still 25% below normal, services can get 
a shot in the arm as herd immunity rises, in part led by 
vaccine roll-out. GDP growth is likely to be strong for the 
next few quarters, rising from -6.3% y-o-y in FY21 to 
11.2% y-o-y in FY22. 
 
But then, what next? By definition, pent-up demand is a 
one-time driver of growth. Once services demand is back 
at pre-pandemic levels, say by end 2021, what will drive 
growth? It is possible that the scars the pandemic leaves 
behind will begin to show up around that same time, 
presenting a double whammy for growth. And this is where 
the centre stepped in with the budget. It tried to introduce 
a new narrative for medium-term growth, namely capital 
expenditure. In particular, it introduced the following: 
 
The capex budget was raised by 0.8% of GDP over two 
years (FY21 and FY22). In fact, only after adjusting for the 
higher capex multipliers is the FY22 fiscal impulse positive. 
 
The government did not impose any new taxes/cesses, nor 
did it make changes in capital gains tax. Our previous work 
has shown that policy stability tends to crowd-in private 
sector capex. 
 
The government outline plans to create two new 
institutions, a bad bank and a DFI, although much will 
depend on the design and implementation over time. 
 
On Feb 5, RBI outlined its role in this new narrative–not 
being the main driver of growth as it was in 2020, but 
playing a supportive role and helping it through its larger-
than-expected market borrowing. 
 
RBI will have to tread the fine line between normalising 
liquidity (especially with inflation likely to be north of the 
4% target over the next year) and maintaining orderly 
conditions in the bond and FX markets. Liquidity switching 
could help. For instance, it could use the space freed up by 
the reversal in CRR cut for bond purchases. Or, in the face 
of a rising trade deficit and falling BoP surplus, it could 
focus more on bond purchases than dollar purchases.RBI 
is expected to start raising the reverse repo rate in 2H2021, 
the repo rate may remain unchanged at 4% over the 
foreseeable future, doing its bit for keeping interest rates 
as low as possible.

Maharashtra is facing a water crisis of unprecedented 
proportions. After years of drought, the river currents have 
ebbed, water in dams and reservoirs have depleted and 
over-exploitation of groundwater has raised concerns 
regarding the long-term availability of water. 
 
Meanwhile, media reports claim IT firms in Chennai are 
asking employees to work from home. The reason is that 
they don’t have enough water to sustain their operations. 
It hasn’t rained for almost 200 days in the city and it may 
not get adequate rain to get over the water crisis for the 
next 3 months. 
 
In North India, the people of arid Thar Desert of Rajasthan 
are spending Rs. 2500 for getting 2500 litres of water 
which they share with their cattle. With Punjab facing the 
threat of desertification and the state struggling to break 
 
12 

 
 
away from the wheat-paddy cycle, farmers in the state 
have been adopting a decade-old scheme to utilise 
underground pipeline system for irrigation. 
 
In light of this crisis, Central government on its part has 
created a Jal Shakti Ministry under a full-fledged cabinet 
minister to resolve the water crisis but a lot more needs to 
be done. There is a huge dependence on monsoon rains to 
replenish most of India’s important water sources such as 
underground aquifers, lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. But 
monsoon is vulnerable to factors such as climate change, 
El-Nino, etc. 
 
Certain regions have surplus amounts of water for their 
need while others face perennial droughts for most of the 
year. For instance, Drought is a recurrent phenomenon in 
Andhra Pradesh where no district is entirely free of 
droughts. Rajasthan is one of the most drought-prone 
areas of India. 
 
Population growth, industrialization, rapid urbanisation, 
rising needs of irrigation and increase in domestic water 
usage have accelerated the demand for water. Since 
urbanization increases in India at a rapid pace = water 
demand will increase rapidly as city dwellers consume 
more water than rural people. 
 
Currently, about 285 million or 33% of India’s total 
population resides in urban areas. By 2050 this figure will 
reach 50%. Rapid urbanisation is adding to the water 
scarcity issue in the country. 
 
Presence of buildings, tar, and cement roads = even if a city 
like Mumbai gets good rains, the rainwater is not retained 
in the area as the water is not allowed to percolate 
underground. 
 
Therefore, water required for cities is largely drawn from 
neighbouring villages and far-off rivers and lakes = 
threatening the availability in those areas. 
 
Large cities also generate large quantities of urban sewage 
which pollutes the freshwater sources and ocean waters. 
However, only about 20% of urban wastewater is currently 
treated globally. In India, the figure is even lower. 
 
A Niti Aayog report predicted that water demand will be 
twice the present supply by 2030 and India could lose up 
to 6% of its GDP during that time. Water shortages are 
hurting India’s capacity to generate electricity because 
40% of thermal power plants are located in areas where 
water scarcity is high.Indian agriculture is heavily 
dependent on monsoon (not dependable) + Ineffective 
agricultural practices in irrigated areas = Water stress in 
agriculture = Poor Cultivation = Farmer suicides. Not only 
farmers are affected by the water crisis, urban dwellers in 
cities and towns across India are also facing a never seen 
before drinking water scarcity. In India, there are conflicts 
between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over sharing of 
Cauvery waters, between Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh 
over sharing of Narmada waters, between Andhra Pradesh 
and Telangana over sharing of Krishna waters, etc. 
 
85. According to the passage, which of the following 
sentences indicate the impact of water crisis? 
(a) It is affecting the electricity generation capacity of 
India as the thermal power plants need water to 
generate electricity. 
 
(b) About 20% of urban wastewater is currently 
treated globally which shows a lower figure, 
 
(c) Rising needs of irrigation and increase in domestic 
water usage have accelerated water crisis in India. 
(d) It has affected the coal mines in India and 
production of coal has reduced drastically. 
 
(e) None of the above

China’s rising power is based on its remarkable economic 
success. Shanghai’s overall economy is currently growing 
at around 13% per year, thus doubling in size every five or 
six years. Everywhere there are start-ups, innovations, and 
young entrepreneurs hungry for profits. In a series of high-
level meetings between Chinese and African officials, the 
advice that the African leaders received from the Chinese 
was sound, and more practical than they typically get from 
the World Bank. Chinese officials stress the crucial role of 
public 
investments, 
especially 
in 
agriculture 
and 
infrastructure, to lay the basis for private sector-led 
growth. In a hungry and poor rural economy, as China was 
in the 1970s and as most of Africa is today, a key starting 
point is to raise farm productivity. 
 
Farmers need the benefits of fertilizer, irrigation and high-
yield seeds, all of which were a core part of China’s 
economical take off. Two other equally critical investments 
are also needed: roads and electricity, without which there 
cannot be a modern economy. Farmers might be able to 
increase their output, but it won’t be able to reach the 
cities, and the cities won’t be able to provide the 
countryside with inputs. 
 
 
13 

 
 
The government has taken pains to ensure that the 
electricity grids and transportation networks reach every 
village in China. 
 
China is prepared to help Africa in substantial ways in 
agriculture, roads, power, health and education. And that is 
not an empty boast. Chinese leaders are prepared to share 
new high yield rice varieties, with their African 
counterparts and, all over Africa, China is financing and 
constructing basic infrastructure. 
 
This illustrates what is wrong with the World Bank. The 
World Bank has often forgotten the most basic lessons of 
development, preferring to lecture the poor and force them 
to privatise basic infrastructure, which is untenable, 
rather than to help the poor to invest in infrastructure and 
other crucial sectors. The Banks’s failure began in the early 
1980s when under the ideological sway of them American 
President and British Prime Minister it tried to get Africa 
and other poor regions to cut back or close down 
government investments and services. 
 
For 25 years, the bank tries to get governments out of 
agriculture, leaving impoverished peasants to fend for 
themselves. The result has been a disaster in Africa, with 
farm productivity stagnant for decades. The bank also 
pushed for privatization of national health systems, water 
utilities, and road and power networks, and has grossly 
underfinanced these critical sectors. 
 
This extreme free-market ideology, also called “structural 
adjustment”, went against the practical lessons of 
development successes in China and the rest or Asia. 
Practical development strategy recognizes that public 
investments - in agriculture, health, education, and 
infrastructure- are necessary complements to private 
investments. The World Bank has instead wrongly seen 
such vital public investments as an enemy of private sector 
development. Whenever the banks’ ideology failed, it has 
blamed the poor for corruption, mismanagement, or lack of 
initiative. 
 
Instead of focusing its attention on helping the poorest 
countries to improve their infrastructure, there has been a 
crusade against corruption. The good news is that African 
governments are getting the message on how to spur 
economic growth and are getting crucial help from China 
and other partners that are less wedded to extreme free-
market ideology than the world Bank. 
 
They have declared their intention to invest in 
infrastructure, agriculture modernization, public health, 
and education. It is clear the Bank can regain its relevance 
only if it becomes practical once again, by returning its 
focus to financing public investments in priority sectors. If 
that happens, the Bank can still do justice to the bold vision 
of a world of shared prosperity that prompted its creation 
after World War II. 
88. Which of the following statements can be inferred from 
the passage? 
(a) Criticize the World Bank for playing a crucial role 
in China’s development but neglecting Australia. 
(b) Make a case for the closure of the World Bank since 
it promotes US interests over those of other 
countries. 
(c) Illustrate how China can play a more concrete role 
in Africa. 
(d) Use China’s success as an example of the changes 
required in World ideology. 
 
(e) None of the above 
 
89. What is the advice given by the author to the World 
Bank? 
(a) Reduce the influence of the Africa and Britain in its 
functioning.  
(b) Adopt a more practical ideology of structural 
adjustment.

basic

Hope and fear are marching in lockstep. The arrival of the 
vaccines represents the ______ (92) _______ (gloom, murk, 
dawn) of hope. Yet, fears about mutations of the virus and 
how politics, which defines public policy, will mutate loom 
large across India’s political economy. Political rhetoric 
propels public expectations and the declaration by Finance 
Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently of “a budget which 
is a budget like never before” will be tested against a billion 
aspirations. The challenge of ______ (93) _______ (revival, 
amelioration, droop) and recovery is located in a parade 
of riveting contrasts. India, it is useful to remember, 
migrated from slowdown to lockdown. The contrast 
between the message beamed by stock indices and indices 
of the real economy are striking to say the least. In the 
period post the high of 2016-17, growth has   _______ (94) 
________ (limped, slid, stumped) consistently and stock 
valuations have risen just as consistently. GDP growth slid 
from 8-plus per cent to hover at around 4 per cent to a 
 
14 

 
 
contraction in the wake of the pandemic, while the 
benchmark Sensex has shot up from around 29,000 points 
to over 47,000 points. How has the fall in growth impacted 
government _______ (95) _______ (expenditure, asset, 
revenues)? In theory, drop in output would result in drop 
in revenues. That though is not necessarily true in the 
Indian context. This week, the government informed India 
that the Goods and Services Tax collections “for December 
2020 recorded all time high since implementation of GST”. 
Even as the economy is in what is called a technical 
recession, which translates into two quarters of negative 
growth, GST collections which averaged at around Rs 
90,000 crore since August 2017, touched the new high of 
Rs 1.15,174 crore for the month of December. GST 
revenues grew even as the economy _______ (96) _______ 
(shrank, dwindled, aggrandized) 7.5 per cent in the July-
Sept 2020 period. 
 
It is not just the Dalal Street vs Main Street picture or the 
GDP vs GST revenues imagery which are curious. 
Conventional economics ________ (97) _________  (postulates, 
ionates, charges ) a correlation between inflation and 
interest rates. Consumer Price Inflation, which was under 
3 per cent in 2017, has seen a secular rise now touching 7.5 
per cent. The RBI’s policy rates though have slid from over 
6.5 per cent to 5.15 per cent in 2019 to 4 per cent in 2020. 
This column has previously highlighted the _________ (98)

savers. Interest rates for depositors with money in a 
savings account halved to 3 per cent — a 365-day deposit 
now fetches what the savings account used to.
