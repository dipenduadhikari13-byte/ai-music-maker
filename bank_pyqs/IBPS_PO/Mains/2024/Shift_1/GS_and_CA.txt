Directions (109-110): Read the following passage and answer the given questions. 
 
Chinese horoscope platforms embody a profound synthesis of antiquated astrological tenets and modern 
interpretative mechanisms. Unlike the heliocentric predilections of Western astrology, the Chinese zodiac operates 
on a dodecennial framework, wherein each annum is governed by a specific zoological archetype—such as the Rat, 
Dragon, or Ox—paired with one of the five metaphysical elements: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, or Water. These elements, 
perpetually oscillating in an intricate cyclical sequence, infuse each zodiac year with distinctive energetic attributes. 
The prognostications are further nuanced by the application of "BaZi," or the Four Pillars of Destiny, which 
meticulously delineates the celestial influences of an individual’s natal year, month, day, and hour. This methodology 
integrates "heavenly stems" and "earthly branches" to construct a symbiotic matrix of cosmic energies. Practitioners 
extrapolate these esoteric alignments to proffer bespoke insights into realms such as professional trajectories, 
interpersonal dynamics, and corporeal well-being, emphasizing consonance with universal rhythms. 
This ancient paradigm underscores an intricate amalgamation of philosophical profundity and contemporary 
digitized execution. 
Q109. What distinguishes the Chinese zodiac’s framework from Western astrology, as explained in the 
passage? 
(a) Chinese zodiac forecasts are anchored exclusively in metaphysical constructs, contrasting with Western 
astrology's foundation on heliocentric principles. 
(b) Western astrology adheres to a twelve-year cyclical framework, whereas the Chinese zodiac emphasizes 
planetary configurations. 
(c) The Chinese zodiac integrates animal archetypes with a quintet of recurring elements, diverging from the annual 
orientation of Western astrology. 
 
 
28 
 
(d) The Chinese zodiac employs the BaZi methodology exclusively, in contrast to Western astrology's reliance on fixed 
celestial reference points. 
(e) Western astrology integrates terrestrial branches, whereas the Chinese zodiac derives its framework solely from 
constellational patterns. 
 
Q110. What can be inferred about the relationship between "heavenly stems" and "earthly branches" in BaZi 
analysis? 
(a) They function in isolation to delineate universal cadences for zodiacal interpretations. 
(b) They center exclusively on physical vitality, exerting negligible influence on relational or occupational analyses. 
(c) They are archaic constructs omitted from the purview of contemporary Chinese astrological methodologies. 
(d) They hinge solely on the natal year to derive both vocational and personal astrological prognostications. 
(e) They constitute an interdependent framework employed to elucidate cosmic influences shaping an individual’s 
essence.

Directions (113-120): Read the following passage and answer the given questions.

Japan is grappling with a demographic crisis as it faces the reality of being one of the oldest nations in the world. 
Recent data shows that more than 10% of Japan’s population is aged 80 or older, while 29% are over the age of 65. 
This aging population, coupled with a declining birth rate, is putting unprecedented pressure on Japan’s government 
and economy. Projections estimate that the population could shrink from its current 125 million to around 96 million 
by 2060. By that time, nearly 40% of the population will be over 65, a demographic scenario unparalleled in modern 
history. 
Recognizing the urgency, the Japanese administration has initiated a quick and lighten movement towards solutions. 
Policymakers are implementing reforms at an accelerated pace to address the challenges posed by this demographic 
shift. Key strategies include providing (A) older citizens to participate (B) in the workforce and encouraging (C)  
incentives for women to remain (D) more actively in the job market. In tandem, efforts to modernize industries are 
being supported by technological advancements such as robotics and artificial intelligence, which are increasingly 
used to fill labor gaps in eldercare and manufacturing. 
Despite these measures, the situation remains complex. Healthcare and pension costs account for approximately 
30% of public expenditure, and sustaining the pension system is becoming increasingly difficult. By 2050, there will 
be nearly one retiree for every working-age person, a stark contrast to the 1970s when the ratio was 1:4. The 
administration’s lighten movement also focuses on incentivizing higher birth rates by investing in childcare 
subsidies, parental leave policies, and family support programs. However, societal preferences for smaller families 
persist, complicating these efforts. 
Culturally, Japan’s historically restrictive stance on immigration continues to slow progress in diversifying the 
workforce. While immigration reform has been explored, achieving substantial change requires overcoming deep-
rooted societal resistance. 
Japan’s quick and lighten movement reflects a determined approach to tackling this demographic crisis, but the road 
ahead demands multifaceted solutions and cultural shifts. The country’s experience serves as a global case study, 
offering lessons for nations facing similar demographic transitions. 
 
Q113. According to the passage, what does the phrase “quick and lighten movement” primarily emphasize in 
Japan’s approach to its aging population crisis? 
(a) A hastily implemented series of policies aimed at completely eliminating the aging population issue by 2050, 
focusing on youth-oriented solutions. 
(b) A strategic and accelerated implementation of multifaceted measures to address the challenges of a declining 
workforce and rising dependency ratios. 
(c) A symbolic gesture by the Japanese government to highlight technological advancements in eldercare without 
addressing broader societal concerns. 
(d) A temporary shift in policy to test immigration-based solutions, primarily designed to delay the effects of an aging 
population. 
(e) A movement to decentralize administrative authority, empowering local governments to manage aging-related 
issues independently. 
 
Q114. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage regarding the global relevance of Japan’s 
demographic crisis? 
(a) Japan’s aging population serves as an isolated case study with minimal implications for nations with diverse 
demographics and robust birth rates. 
 
 
30 
 
(b) The challenges faced by Japan highlight the importance of cultural adaptability in implementing effective 
immigration reforms. 
(c) Other nations with aging populations must adopt Japan’s robotics and AI strategies to completely resolve their 
demographic challenges. 
(d) Japan’s experience underscores the need for immediate global attention to pension sustainability and workforce 
management as universal concerns. 
(e) Comprehensive government intervention alone is sufficient to address the issues of aging populations worldwide. 
 
Q115. If the trend of Japan’s population shrinking to 96 million by 2060 continues, what might be inferred 
about its global economic ranking? 
(a) Japan will likely maintain its economic position due to advances in automation and exports. 
(b) Japan’s economy may contract due to a reduced labor force and declining domestic demand. 
(c) The shrinking population will attract foreign investment to fill labor and productivity gaps. 
(d) Japan will experience sustained economic growth through technological leadership. 
(e) The demographic trends will have minimal impact on Japan's global economic role. 
 
Q116. Which of the following accurately reflects Japan’s strategies to cope with its aging population? 
(I) Encouraging older citizens to continue working while adopting robotics to fill labor gaps. 
(II) Providing substantial childcare subsidies to boost the birth rate and offset the shrinking workforce. 
(III) Rapidly expanding immigration policies to increase the workforce and reduce dependency ratios. 
 
(a) Only (I) 
(b) Both (I) and (II) 
(c) Only (III)

Q120. What does the passage imply about the role of historical factors in shaping Japan’s current 
demographic situation? 
(a) Historical immigration policies have contributed significantly to the rising percentage of elderly citizens. 
(b) Past declines in birth rates have compounded the current population decline and aging demographic. 
(c) Japan’s historical focus on industrial growth has stabilized population trends over time. 
(d) The aging population trend in Japan is unrelated to historical factors and is solely a recent development. 
(e) Historical increases in fertility rates have delayed the aging population crisis until now.
