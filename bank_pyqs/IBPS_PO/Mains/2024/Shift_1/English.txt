Paragraph 1: Customer service plays a pivotal role in shaping a company's reputation and ensuring customer 
satisfaction. According to recent studies, 86% of customers are willing to pay more for a better customer experience, 
highlighting the critical need for businesses to prioritize service quality. Speed, efficiency, and personalization are 
the top three factors customers value when interacting with service teams. Moreover, 60% of customers report 
abandoning a business after a poor service experience, illustrating the tangible impact of substandard support. With 
advancements in technology, tools like chatbots, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and 
omnichannel platforms have become essential for delivering seamless interactions. 
Paragraph 2: In addition to technological advancements, human touch remains indispensable in fostering trust and 
loyalty. Nearly 70% of customers prefer speaking to a live agent for complex issues, emphasizing the importance of 
empathy and problem-solving skills in customer service roles. Companies that invest in employee training to enhance 
these skills report a 23% higher satisfaction rate among customers. Furthermore, businesses that resolve complaints 
quickly (within 24 hours) are 15% more likely to retain customers compared to those with delayed resolutions.

sustainability.

Directions (98-102): Read the following passage and answer the given questions. 
 
Online marketing has dramatically reshaped the way products and services are presented, especially for younger 
audiences who dominate the digital space. Platforms like social media, streaming services, and personalized ads are 
central to this transformation, relying on advanced algorithms to tailor promotional content. For youth, this means a 
daily influx of messages that are often indistinguishable from entertainment. 
This digital strategy significantly shapes the purchasing habits of young people. Continuous exposure to targeted ads 
tends to drive impulsive shopping, fueled further by the endorsements of influencers. These influencers, who often 
appear relatable, lend authenticity to promotions, making them far more persuasive than traditional advertisements. 
As a result, young consumers are not just passive buyers but active trendsetters, analyzing market demands in a 
predictive manner. 
However, there is a downside to this influence. Online marketing frequently glamorizes products, portraying 
lifestyles that many young people aspire to but may not realistically achieve. Such aspirational content can result in 
financial strain as they attempt to keep up with these idealized images. Additionally, this constant exposure to rapid, 
attention-grabbing content is thought to contribute to shorter attention spans among the younger generation. 
Despite these concerns, there are notable benefits to online marketing for youth. It offers them access to a wide 
range of products and the ability to make more informed decisions through reviews and comparisons. For young 
entrepreneurs, digital platforms serve as a springboard for showcasing their products and reaching a global 
audience. Yet, ethical questions loom large, particularly around privacy and the use of personal data, as companies 
strive to maximize profits without always considering consumer well-being. 
In essence, online marketing is a double-edged sword. It has brought convenience and innovation, but its implications 
for youth demand ongoing attention to ensure that its influence remains positive and balanced. 
 
 
 
25 
 
Q98. What dual nature of online marketing's influence on youth is emphasized in the passage? 
(a) It promotes both financial independence among youth by offering comparative purchasing tools and impulsive 
buying through emotional advertisements driven by influencers. 
(b) It simultaneously provides access to a diverse range of products and services through online platforms and 
creates unrealistic lifestyle aspirations through glamorized marketing strategies. 
(c) It fosters shorter attention spans among youth due to constant exposure to high-speed, engaging content, while 
also promoting financial discipline through structured promotional campaigns. 
(d) It enables market dominance by social media influencers who shape consumer trends, while diminishing the 
relatability of conventional celebrity endorsements. 
(e) It glamorizes consumerism and aspirational lifestyles, reducing the focus on product quality and customer 
satisfaction in the marketing narrative. 
 
Q99. How does the role of influencers in online marketing contrast with traditional advertisements, as 
described in the passage? 
(a) Influencers help curb impulsive purchasing tendencies by fostering trust through personalized endorsements, 
unlike traditional advertisements which rely on broad and impersonal messaging strategies. 
(b) Influencers focus on driving trends through their social media presence and interactive content, which contrasts 
with traditional advertisements that primarily aim to reinforce brand identity through repetitive visual and auditory 
cues. 
(c) Influencers depend on advanced algorithmic analysis of youth behavior to deliver targeted content, unlike 
traditional advertisements which are created based on extensive focus group studies and demographic assumptions. 
(d) Influencers contribute to a sense of relatability and authenticity by endorsing products in a personal context, 
whereas traditional advertisements often lack this individual connection and rely on generalized promotional 
content. 
(e) Influencers entirely replace the need for personalized marketing by integrating into the audience's lifestyle, 
unlike traditional ads which are largely ineffective in delivering tailored messages.
