Directions (110-115): Read the given passage and answer the questions based on that 
What it means to "explain" something in science often comes down to the application of mathematics. 
Some thinkers hold that mathematics is a kind of language--a systematic contrivance of signs, the criteria 
for the authority of which are internal coherence, elegance, and depth. The application of such a highly 
artificial system to the physical world, they claim, results in the creation of a kind of statement about the 
world. Accordingly, what matters in the sciences is finding a mathematical concept that attempts, as other 
language does, to describe the functioning of some aspect of the world. 
At the center of the issue of scientific knowledge can thus be found questions about the relationship 
between language and what it refers to. A discussion about the role played by language in the pursuit of 
knowledge has been going on among linguists for several decades. The debate is on whether language 
corresponds in some essential way to objects and behaviors, making knowledge a solid and reliable 
commodity; or, on the other hand, whether the relationship between language and things is purely a 
matter of agreed-upon conventions, making knowledge tenuous, relative, and inexact. 
Lately the latter theory has been gaining wider acceptance. According to linguists who support this 
theory, the way language is used varies depending upon changes in accepted practices and theories 
among those who work in particular discipline. These linguists argue that, in the pursuit of knowledge, a 
statement is true only when there are no promising alternatives that might lead one to question it. 
Certainly, this characterization would seem to be applicable to the sciences. In science, a mathematical 
statement may be taken to account for every aspect of a phenomenon it is applied to, but some would 
argue, there is nothing inherent in mathematical language. Under this view, acceptance of a mathematical 
statement by the scientific community--by virtue of the statement's predictive power or methodological 
efficiency--transforms what is basically an analogy or metaphor into an explanation of the physical 
process in question, to be held as true until another, more compelling analogy takes its place. 
 
Q110. Why mathematics is considered as a language by some experts? 
(a) Similar to a language, mathematics uses syntax and sign within a discipline 
(b) Mathematics can accurately describe real-world problems and abstract concepts. 
(c) Mathematics is widely used subject, universal to everyone. 
(d) Only (a) and (b) 
(e) All of these 
32 

 
 
Q111. What is the reason of contention among the linguists? 
(a) The debate is centered around language’s reachability in providing a reliable communication over 
being just an agreed-upon convention. 
(b) The discussion is over whether language is an effective medium of connecting all section of society 
irrespective financial status. 
(c) The debate is on giving mathematics the universal language status. 
(d) The discussion is on creating a single language effective in all countries.  
(e) None of these 
 
Q112. Which of the following can be best inferred from the third paragraph of the given passage? 
(a) Mathematics isn’t so much a precise statement, as an imprecise metaphor or analogy that will work 
until a better one comes along. 
(b) Some linguists argue that the intrinsic nature of mathematics does not corresponds the conclusive 
idea of language. 
(c) Mathematics lacks the syntax and logic that a general language hold. 
(d) only (a) and (b) 
(e) All of these 
 
Q113. Which of the following is the main idea of the passage? 
(a) Claiming mathematics a language is an obtrusive idea. 
(b) The fundamental of mathematics is in complete in line with the concept of language 
(c) Though being argued, perceiving mathematics as a language cannot be ruled out. 
(d) Only (a) and (b) 
(e) Only (b) and (c)
