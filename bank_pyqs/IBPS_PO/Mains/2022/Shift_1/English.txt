Directions (81-83): Read the passage and answer the following questions based on that 
It has recently been discovered that many attributions of paintings to the seventeenth-century Dutch 
artist Rembrandt may be false. The contested paintings are not minor works, whose removal from the 
Rembrandt corpus would leave it relatively unaffected: they are at its very center. In her recent book, 
Svetlana Alpers uses these cases of disputed attribution as a point of departure for her provocative 
discussion of the radical distinctiveness of Rembrandt's approach to painting. 
Alpers argues that Rembrandt exercised an unprecedentedly firm control over his art, his students, and 
the distribution of his works. Despite Gary Schwartz's brilliant documentation of Rembrandt's 
complicated relations with a wide circle of patrons, Alpers takes the view that Rembrandt refused to 
submit to the prevailing patronage system. He preferred, she claims, to sell his works on the open market 
and to play the entrepreneur. At a time when Dutch artists were organizing into professional 
brotherhoods and academies, Rembrandt stood up. In fact, Alpers portrait of Rembrandt shows virtually 
every aspect of his art pervaded by economic motives. Indeed, so complete was Rembrandt's involvement 
with the market, she argues, that he even presented himself as commodity, viewing his studio's products 
as extensions of himself, sent out into the world to earn money. Alpers asserts that Rembrandt's 
enterprise is found not just in his paintings, but in his refusal to limit his enterprise to those paintings he 
actually painted.  
 
Q81. Why is the work of seventeenth-century Dutch artist Rembrandt a matter of scrutiny? 
(a) The authenticity of major portion of Rembrandt work is being disputed and believed to be 
counterfeits. 
(b) The inconsistent characteristics of Rembrandt arts have raised series of questions over their 
originality. 
(c) The huge age gap between the art, when arranged chronologically, has questioned the validity the 
artwork of being the original Rembrandt. 
(d) Only (b) and (c) 
(e) None of these 
 
Q82. Which of the following is /are the argument(s) given by Svetlana Alpers about Rembrandt? 
(a) Alpers had a firm belief in the originality of each Rembrandt artwork. 
(b) Alpers claimed that Rembrandt had never shied away to concede to the contemporary patronage 
system 
(c) Alpers argued that Rembrandt’s art was largely determined by his view of the art’s marketplace. 
(d) Only (a) and (b) 
(e) Only (b) and (c)

Directions (89-95): Read the given passage and answer the questions based on that 
Marketing is all about connecting with the customer. And in today’s marketplace, customers are changing. 
Their needs, demands, wants, attitudes, mindsets, behavior, habits, consumption are changing. Especially 
given the rapid change not only in technological development and tools, but also their adoption into 
normal everyday life, marketing is — or needs to — change along with the times. It has been seen that the 
traditional consumers are more predictable a creature of habit. The new ones are more socially aware, 
and thus often more responsive to socially responsible consumption of goods and services. Having more 
information at their fingertips, many customers are much more judicious giving them more confidence — 
and also less inclined to blindly consume spoon-fed information from brands and companies. This means 
they are the new _______________ for growth. 
Millennials may seem like an overused term nowadays, but there is no denying the importance these 
customers have on the way companies do business. Keeping this in mind, brands should be more 
conscious and wiser in the way they interact with their clients and customers. Part of this is developing 
marketing that does not lose touch with customers; marketing that the customers of today can relate to. 
Companies’ survival will thus be contingent on better understanding this new crop of customers, as well 
as how the current environment — one that is largely digital in nature — factors into how these 
customers think, behave and consume. And thus, Marketing 4.0 was born. 
But you cannot talk about Marketing 4.0 without tackling what came before. Marketing 1.0 was largely 
productional based and the most basic, born out of the manufacturing boom in the 1950’s. But the crisis 
in the 70’s and 80’s created Marketing 2.0, which is also called relational marketing. Here, consumers 
started becoming more smarter in their spending (given the economic hardship prevalent at that time), 
meaning companies needed to find things customers could relate to in order to prompt a positive, 
beneficial response. Marketing departments now classified customers through basic profiling, and 
companies were beginning to understand the importance and impact of customer loyalty, engagement, 
and advocacy. The evolution of the old approach gave birth to Marketing 3.0, where the objective was to 
meet both the rational and emotional needs of customers. It’s also called the “appeal to emotion,” or 
“emotional marketing.” As opposed to the two previous approaches where the market was seen as 
product driven (Marketing 1.0), mass market with smarter customers (Marketing 2.0), Marketing 3.0 saw 
customers as people, instead of just segments. 
 
Q89. How new generation consumers are different from traditional ones?

(b) The new consumers are more mindful and sensible than the later ones 
(c) The new consumers are more informed and discerned comparative to their previous ones 
(d) Only (b) and (c) 
(e) All of these 
 
Q90. How brands should interact with the new aged customers? 
(a) Brands should position their marketing strategies according to new-age customers’ evolved needs 
(b) Brands should recognize the consumer behavior and their digital presence 
(c) Brands should be decisive and aware of their interaction and behavior with their consumers.
