Directions (58-65): Read the following passage and 
answer the given questions. Certain words are 
highlighted to answer some of the questions. 
Language is more than just a tool for communication; it is 
also a gateway to sharper thinking and wider opportunities. 
Over the years, researchers have highlighted the benefits of 
bilingualism as compared to monolingualism. While a 
monolingual person relies on a single language, a bilingual 
or multilingual individual manages two or more languages 
with ease, which significantly boosts cognitive abilities. 
In 2019, a study was conducted that revealed remarkable 
findings. It was discovered that individuals who were 
bilingual demonstrated better calculation speed and higher 
intelligence levels than their monolingual counterparts. 
This research confirmed what many educators had long 
believed: bilingualism provides mental agility that 
monolingualism simply cannot. The ability to switch 
between languages seems ______________ with the additional 
skill of switching between tasks more efficiently. Later, 
further investigations reinforced this conclusion, pointing 
out that bilinguals are exceptional in solving problems and 
making quicker decisions. 
The advantages of bilingualism also extend to the 
professional world. In regions where poverty and limited 
resources 
prevail, 
bilingual 
workers 
show 
greater 
adaptability. They can handle diverse work areas where 
communication across cultures is essential. In such settings, 
monolinguals often face a decline in effectiveness, while 
bilinguals continue to thrive by bridging language barriers 
and creating smoother interactions.

Children provide another fascinating example. Kids who 
grow up in foreign countries, especially those under the age 
of six, are more likely to develop bilingualism naturally. For 
instance, children of diplomats often pick up more than one 
language early in life. These children not only master new 
languages with surprising ease but also perform 
outstandingly in academic and social spheres. Their 
bilingual upbringing grants them a mental flexibility that 
gives them an edge over monolingual peers. 
Thus, the benefits of bilingualism are far-reaching. From 
improved intelligence and quicker problem-solving skills to 
broader job opportunities and cultural adaptability, 
bilinguals enjoy advantages that monolinguals do not. In a 
globalized world where cross-cultural understanding is 
vital, being bilingual or multilingual is not just an added 
skill—it is a necessity for success. 
 
Q58. According to the passage, what is the main advantage 
of being bilingual in low-resource professional settings?

(b) Bilinguals can work longer hours without facing 
language-related fatigue. 
(c) Bilinguals improve communication and adapt better in

specialized training.
