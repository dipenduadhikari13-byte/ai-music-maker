IBPS PO Prelims Memory Based 2024 (English Language) 
 
Directions (36-43): Read the following passage and answer the given questions. Certain words are 
highlighted to answer some of the questions. 
Emotional intelligence (EQ) is increasingly recognized as a key component of success in both personal and 
professional realms. While men and women may possess similar overall levels of EQ, research consistently 
shows that they tend to excel in different emotional competencies. Women often score higher in areas such 
as empathy, interpersonal relationships, and social responsibility, whereas men tend to perform better in 
assertiveness, stress tolerance, and self-regard (or confidence). These differences lay the foundation for 
the distinct emotional approaches each gender brings to the workplace, shaped by both biological factors 
and the powerful process of socialization. 
Socialization plays a significant role in determining these gender-specific strengths. From an early age, boys 
and girls receive different messages about how they should behave. Boys are often ___________ to be 
competitive, confident, assertive, and decisive, and are taught that winning is of primary importance. Girls, 
on the other hand, are socialized to be nurturing, empathetic, and emotionally expressive. They learn to 
value relationships and cooperation over competition. These early experiences influence the development 
of specific emotional intelligence skills, with boys becoming more assertive and confident and girls 
excelling in empathy and interpersonal communication. 
As boys and girls grow into adults, these learned behaviors are reinforced by societal norms and 
expectations. In the workplace, these socialized behaviors manifest in ways that can impact professional 
roles and leadership opportunities. Men’s strengths in assertiveness and self-regard often give them an 
advantage in competitive environments, helping them excel in leadership positions. Meanwhile, women’s 
strengths in empathy and interpersonal relationships make them highly effective in teamwork and 
collaborative settings, though these skills are sometimes undervalued in leadership hierarchies. 
These gender-based differences in emotional intelligence may contribute to the leadership gender gap. 
Men's natural tendencies toward assertiveness and confidence can help them rise in hierarchical 
structures, while women’s empathy and relational strengths are often better suited for team-oriented roles. 
Recognizing and valuing these differences can help organizations leverage the diverse emotional strengths 
of both genders, fostering a more balanced and inclusive leadership landscape.

Solutions 
 
S36. Ans.(c) 
Sol. According to the passage, emotional intelligence is shaped significantly by socialization, not just 
biological factors, making statement (I) false. However, statements (II) and (III) are true because the 
passage states that women excel in empathy, social responsibility, and interpersonal relationships, while 
men perform better in assertiveness and stress tolerance. 
Analysis: 
1. (I) Emotional intelligence (EQ) is primarily shaped by biological factors, with little influence 
from socialization. 
o 
The passage states that both biological factors and socialization shape emotional intelligence, but it 
emphasizes that socialization plays a significant role in shaping gender-specific EQ strengths. 
Therefore, this statement is false because it incorrectly downplays the role of socialization. 
2. (II) Women tend to excel in empathy, social responsibility, and interpersonal relationships 
according to research. 
o 
The passage directly supports this claim: “Women often score higher in areas such as empathy, 
interpersonal relationships, and social responsibility.” 
o 
This statement is true. 
9 

 
3. (III) Assertiveness and stress tolerance are often considered key emotional competencies where 
men perform better. 
o 
The passage mentions: “Men tend to perform better in assertiveness, stress tolerance, and self-regard.” 
o 
This statement is true. 
Based on this analysis, the correct answer is: (c) Both (II) and (III) are true. 
 
S37. Ans.(b) 
Sol. Statement (b) is false because the passage highlights that men's assertiveness and self-regard give 
them an advantage in competitive and hierarchical leadership roles, not women’s relational strengths. 
Women’s strengths are better suited for teamwork and collaborative settings. The other statements 
accurately reflect the passage. 
Analysis: 
1. (a) Men’s assertiveness and self-regard give them an advantage in hierarchical leadership 
positions. 
o 
The passage states: “Men’s strengths in assertiveness and self-regard often give them an advantage in 
competitive environments, helping them excel in leadership positions.” 
o 
This statement is correct. 
2. (b) Women’s relational strengths are particularly well-suited for competitive, high-pressure 
roles in leadership. 
o 
The passage contrasts men’s assertiveness and confidence with women’s strengths in empathy and 
interpersonal relationships. It suggests that women’s skills are well-suited for teamwork and 
collaboration but implies that these skills may not always be valued in competitive leadership 
roles. 
o 
This statement is incorrect because women’s relational strengths are described as better suited 
for team-oriented roles, not high-pressure, competitive leadership environments. 
3. (c) Boys are often encouraged to be decisive and assertive from an early age. 
o 
The passage states: “Boys are often encouraged to be competitive, confident, assertive, and decisive.” 
o 
This statement is correct. 
4. (d) Socialization influences the development of emotional competencies for both genders. 
o 
The passage emphasizes that socialization plays a significant role in shaping emotional 
intelligence for both men and women. 
o 
This statement is correct. 
5. (e) Emotional intelligence skills learned in childhood are reinforced by societal norms as 
individuals grow older. 
o 
The passage states: “As boys and girls grow into adults, these learned behaviors are reinforced by 
societal norms and expectations.” 
o 
This statement is correct. 
The incorrect statement is: (b) Women’s relational strengths are particularly well-suited for 
competitive, high-pressure roles in leadership. 
 
S38. Ans.(b) 
Sol. Statement (I) is true because the passage explains that women’s emotional intelligence strengths like 
empathy and relational skills are undervalued in leadership roles. Statement (III) is also true, as the passage 
indicates that societal norms reinforce the emotional skills developed in childhood. However, statement 
(II) is false because men are said to excel in competitive environments, not necessarily in teamwork and 
collaborative settings, which are associated more with women’s strengths. 
10 

 
Analysis: 
1. (I) Women’s emotional intelligence strengths are undervalued in hierarchical structures, 
particularly in leadership positions. 
o 
The passage mentions: “Women’s strengths in empathy and interpersonal relationships make them 
highly effective in teamwork and collaborative settings, though these skills are sometimes undervalued 
in leadership hierarchies.” 
o 
This statement is true. 
2. (II) Men tend to perform better in teamwork and collaborative settings due to their confidence. 
o 
The passage does not suggest that men excel in teamwork and collaboration due to their confidence. 
In fact, it states that women are better suited for collaborative environments due to their empathy 
and relational skills. 
o 
This statement is false. 
3. (III) Societal expectations reinforce the emotional competencies that boys and girls develop 
early in life. 
o 
The passage states: “As boys and girls grow into adults, these learned behaviors are reinforced by 
societal norms and expectations.” 
o 
This statement is true. 
The correct answer is: (b) Both (I) and (III) are true. 
 
S39. Ans.(a) 
Sol. In the context of the passage, “lay” is used in the phrase “lay the foundation,” which means to establish 
or set the groundwork for something. Therefore, the word that has a similar meaning is establish (a). The 
other options do not fit this context. 
Meanings: 
1. (a) Establish – This means to set up or lay the foundation for something. This matches the meaning of 
"lay" in the passage. 
o 
Hindi meaning: स्थापित करना 
2. (b) Cover – This means to place something over or conceal something. 
o 
Hindi meaning: ढकना 
3. (c) Remove – This means to take away or eliminate.

o 
Hindi meaning: खाटरज करना 
 
S40. Ans.(c) 
Sol. The passage suggests that recognizing and valuing both genders' emotional strengths can foster a 
more inclusive and balanced leadership. Thus, (c) can be inferred. (a) is incorrect because the passage notes 
that women’s strengths are often undervalued in leadership. (b) is false because both societal and biological 
factors contribute to these differences. (d) oversimplifies the issue, while (e) is incorrect as collaboration 
between genders is possible, given their complementary emotional competencies. 
11 

 
Analysis: 
1. (a) Women’s strengths in empathy and interpersonal relationships make them more suitable for 
leadership roles than men. 
o 
The passage does not state that women are more suitable for leadership roles than men. It indicates 
that women excel in empathy and relationships but that these strengths may be undervalued in 
hierarchical leadership positions. 
o 
This statement is incorrect. 
2. (b) Men’s performance in assertiveness and confidence is exclusively the result of societal 
conditioning, with no biological factors involved. 
o 
The passage mentions that both biological factors and socialization shape emotional 
competencies, so it is incorrect to say that men’s performance is exclusively due to societal 
conditioning. 
o 
This statement is incorrect. 
3. (c) Organizations that recognize and value both genders' emotional strengths can create more 
balanced and effective leadership. 
o 
The passage supports this inference: “Recognizing and valuing these differences can help 
organizations leverage the diverse emotional strengths of both genders, fostering a more balanced and 
inclusive leadership landscape.” 
o 
This statement is correct. 
4. (d) Women are less likely to succeed in competitive environments because they lack confidence 
and assertiveness. 
o 
The passage does mention that men often outperform women in assertiveness and confidence, but 
it does not suggest that women are less likely to succeed overall. It emphasizes different strengths 
rather than a lack of ability in competitive environments. 
o 
This statement is incorrect. 
5. (e) Emotional intelligence competencies between men and women are so different that they 
cannot effectively collaborate in professional settings. 
o 
The passage does not state that the differences between men and women’s emotional intelligence 
are so vast that they cannot collaborate. In fact, it suggests that recognizing and valuing both 
strengths can be beneficial in workplaces. 
o 
This statement is incorrect. 
The correct answer is: (c) Organizations that recognize and value both genders' emotional strengths 
can create more balanced and effective leadership. 
 
S41. Ans.(d) 
Sol. The passage clearly explains that societal norms play a significant role in reinforcing gender-specific 
emotional skills, where men excel in assertiveness and competition, and women in empathy and 
teamwork. Hence, (d) is the correct inference. (a) is incorrect as societal norms affect both genders. (b) is 
false because boys and girls are socialized to develop different emotional skills. (c) is incorrect since 
emotional intelligence can evolve. (e) contradicts the passage, which emphasizes the influence of 
socialization. 
Analysis: 
1. (a) Societal norms only affect women’s emotional intelligence, particularly in developing 
empathy and interpersonal skills. 
o 
The passage states that societal norms influence both men and women, shaping different emotional 
competencies for each gender (assertiveness for men and empathy for women). 
o 
This statement is incorrect because societal norms affect both genders, not just women. 
12 

 
2. (b) Boys and girls are socialized in a way that equally promotes both assertiveness and empathy 
in both genders. 
o 
The passage explicitly states that boys and girls are socialized differently, with boys encouraged to 
be assertive and girls encouraged to be empathetic. There is no indication of equal promotion of 
both traits in both genders. 
o 
This statement is incorrect. 
3. (c) Emotional intelligence is fixed and cannot be influenced or altered once societal norms have 
shaped it during childhood. 
o 
The passage does not suggest that emotional intelligence is fixed. It implies that societal norms 
shape emotional intelligence but does not say that these traits are unchangeable. 
o 
This statement is incorrect. 
4. (d) Societal expectations reinforce gender-specific emotional skills, leading to men excelling in 
competitive environments and women in teamwork. 
o 
This aligns with the passage, which explains that boys are socialized to develop assertiveness and 
confidence, which help in competitive environments, while girls develop empathy and relationship-
building skills, making them more effective in teamwork settings. 
o 
This statement is correct. 
5. (e) Societal norms have no influence on emotional competencies, which are purely biologically 
determined. 
o 
The passage clearly states that both societal norms and biological factors shape emotional 
intelligence. Therefore, societal norms do have an influence. 
o 
This statement is incorrect. 
The correct answer is: (d) Societal expectations reinforce gender-specific emotional skills, leading to 
men excelling in competitive environments and women in teamwork. 
S42. Ans.(a) 
Sol. The word “approach” means to move closer or come near something. The opposite of this would be to 
withdraw or move away from something, making withdraw (a) the correct antonym. The other options 
do not provide an opposite meaning to “approach.” 
Meanings: 
1. (a) Withdraw – This means to pull back or move away, which is the opposite of “approach.” 
o 
Hindi meaning: िीछे हटना 
o 
This is the correct antonym of "approach." 
2. (b) Assist – This means to help or support, which is not the opposite of “approach.” 
o 
Hindi meaning: सहायता करना 
3. (c) Destroy – This means to completely ruin or demolish, which doesn’t directly relate to the meaning 
of "approach." 
o Hindi meaning: नष्ट करना 
4. (d) Engage – This means to involve or participate, which is not the opposite of “approach.” 
o 
Hindi meaning: संलग्न करना 
5. (e) Leverage – This means to use something to its maximum advantage, which is not related to the 
opposite of "approach." 
o Hindi meaning: लाभ उठाना 
13 

 
 
S43. Ans.(c) 
Sol. The correct word is encouraged (c), as the passage explains that boys are socially conditioned to 
develop traits such as competitiveness and assertiveness. The other options do not accurately reflect the 
positive reinforcement described in the sentence. 
Meanings: 
1. (a) Persuaded – This means to convince someone to do something. It can work in the sentence, but it 
implies a personal choice rather than societal influence. 
o 
Hindi meaning: मनाना, राजी करना 
2. (b) Discouraged – This means to deter someone from doing something, which is the opposite of what 
the sentence is suggesting (as boys are not discouraged from being competitive and assertive). 
o 
Hindi meaning: हतोत्सापहत करना 
3. (c) Encouraged – This means to inspire or motivate someone to do something, which fits the context 
of boys being pushed toward competitiveness and assertiveness. 
o 
Hindi meaning: प्रोत्सापहत करना 
o 
This is the correct word for the blank. 
4. (d) Influenced – This means to have an effect on someone, but it’s a broader term and doesn’t 
specifically fit the sentence in the way “encouraged” does. 
o 
Hindi meaning: प्रभापित करना 
5. (e) Restricted – This means to limit or confine, which doesn’t fit the context, as boys are not being 
restricted from these behaviors. 
o 
Hindi meaning: प्रपतबंपित करना 
The correct word is (c) Encouraged. 
 
S44. Ans.(b) 
Sol. The incorrect word in the sentence is (b) activities. The word "activities" is plural, but the verb "was" 
is singular. The word activities should be "activity" to match the singular verb “was”. 
Corrected sentence: 
The children's favorite activity at the camp was hiking through the forest trails. 
Meanings of the highlighted words: 
1. Favorite 
o 
English: Preferred or liked more than others. 
o 
Hindi: िसंदीदा 
2. Activities 
o

S46. Ans.(d) 
Sol. The correct statements are (I) and (II). 
(I) is correct. "The team" is a collective noun, but it is treated as singular in this context, so "deserves" is 
the correct verb form. 
(II) is correct. The sentence structure is sound, and both parts of the sentence are grammatically correct. 
(III) is incorrect. The subject "Each of the students" is singular, so it should be "Each of the students was 
required..." 
S47. Ans.(d) 
Sol. The incorrect sentences are (I) and (II). 
(I) is incorrect. The correct form is "The manager, along with her team, was discussing..." because the 
subject "manager" is singular, and the phrase "along with her team" does not change that. 
(II) is incorrect. The correct form is "If I had known about the event earlier..." since "would have" cannot 
be used in the "if" clause of a conditional sentence. 
(III) is correct. The sentence is grammatically and contextually accurate. 
(e) All (I), (II), and (III) 
 
S48. Ans.(b) 
Sol.  
(I) is incorrect. The correct form is "If you had studied harder, you could have passed the exam." The past 
perfect "had" should be used instead of "would have." 
(II) is correct. The sentence is grammatically accurate and contextually logical. 
(III) is correct. The subject-verb agreement is appropriate, and the sentence makes sense both 
grammatically and contextually.

singular verb.

(d) captivated 
• Meaning in English: To hold someone’s attention or interest.
