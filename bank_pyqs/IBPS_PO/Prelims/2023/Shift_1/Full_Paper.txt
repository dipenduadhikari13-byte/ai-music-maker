100 Questions
Que. 1
Read the given passage and answer the questions that follow.
It is not too late. It never will be. Whatever you may have read over the past year — as extreme weather
brought a global heatwave and unprecedented wildfires burned through 1.6 million California acres and
newspaper headlines declared, “Climate Change Is Here” — global warming is not binary. It is not a matter of
“yes” or “no”. Instead, it is a problem that gets worse over time the longer we produce greenhouse gas and can be
made better if we choose to stop. Which means that no matter how hot it gets, no matter how fully climate
change transforms the planet and the way we live on it, it will always be the case that the next decade could
contain more warming, and more suffering, or less warming and less suffering. Just how much is up to us, and
always will be.
A century and a half after the greenhouse effect was first identified, and a few decades since climate denial and
misinformation began muddying our sense of what scientists do know, we are left with a set of predictions that
can appear falsifiable — about global temperatures and sea-level rise and even hurricane frequency and wildfire
volume. And there are, it is true, feedback loops in the climate system that we do not yet perfectly understand and
dynamic processes that remain mysterious. But to the extent that we live today under clouds of uncertainty about
the future of climate change, those clouds are, overwhelmingly, not projections of collective ignorance about the
natural world but blindness about the human one, and they can be dispersed by human action. The question of
how bad things will get is not, actually, a test of the science; it is a bet on human activity. How much will we do
to forestall disaster and how quickly?
These are the disconcerting, contradictory lessons of global warming, which counsels both human humility and
human grandiosity, each drawn from the same perception of peril. There’s a name for those who hold the fate of
the world in their hands, as we do — gods. But for the moment, at least, many of us seem inclined to run from
that responsibility rather than embrace it. Or even admit that we see it, though it sits in front of us as plainly as a
steering wheel. That climate change is all-enveloping means that it targets us all and that we must all share in the
responsibility so we do not all share in the suffering — at least not share in so suffocatingly much of it.
Since I first began writing about climate a few years ago, I’ve been asked often whether I see any reason for
optimism. The thing is, I am optimistic. But optimism is always a matter of perspective, and mine is this: No one
wants to believe disaster is coming, but those who look, do. At about two degrees Celsius of warming, just one
degree north of where we are today, some of the planet’s ice sheets are expected to begin their collapse,
eventually bringing, over centuries, perhaps as much as 50 feet of sea-level rise. In the meantime, major cities in
the equatorial band of the planet will become unlivable.
