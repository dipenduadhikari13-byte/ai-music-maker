Sol. Phone S is neither most expensive nor cheapest among all. The cost of three phones is there 
between phone S and phone J. Phone G is just cheaper than phone J. There are three possible cases. 
 
The number of phones cheaper to phone G is equal to the phones expensive to phone A. The cost of two 
phones is there between phone A and phone L which is just cheaper to phone D. Case 2 and case 3 will 
eliminate here.  
 
Now, the remaining phone is phone K. The cost of 2nd most expensive phone is 98k and 3rd cheapest 
phone is 60K. It means the cost of phone S is 98K and the cost of phone K is 60K.
