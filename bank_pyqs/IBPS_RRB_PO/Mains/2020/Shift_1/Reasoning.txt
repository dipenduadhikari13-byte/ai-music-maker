7. (d): I. Q = B (True) Either or  
 
 
II. Q ≤B (True) 
 
 
III. B < Z (False)  
 
 
IV. B > U (True) 
 
Directions (8-12): 
 
8. (e): By using statement I, II, and III, we get Box B7 is 
kept two places below Box B3.

9. (d): By using all the statement we get C is either niece 
or nephew of G. 
 
 
 
 
10. (e): By using statement I, II and III we get the code for 
‘candid’ as ‘pa’. 
 
11. (d): By using statement I, II, III we get two Possibilities 
for place of T. 
 
 
 
 
12. (d): By using statement I, II and III we get two

Direction (13-14): 
 
13. (d): The order of height is: 
 
 
H > C(175cm) > A/F(170cm) > A/F > D > 
E(160cm) > B > G 
 
 
Sum of height of A and E is 325cm when F is taller 
than A, then height of A will be 165cm. so the 
possible height of D will be 161cm. 
 
14. (b): The order of height is: 
 
 
H > C (175cm) >A/ F (170cm) > A/F > D > E 
(160cm) > B > G 
 
 
If the Sum of height of C and H is 360cm, then 
height of H =185cm. and the sum of height of G and 
E is 325 cm, then height of G= 165cm. Sum of 
height of H and G = (185 + 165) = 350cm. 
 
 
Direction (15-16):  
 
15. (a): Since the advertisement invites ‘intelligent’ 
students by promising them and improved 
performance through their exceptional coaching, 
so both I and II are implicit. However, nothing can 
be assumed about other institutes as the given 
advertisement talks of only a particular institute. 
So, III is not implicit.  
 
16. (d): The statement expresses grave concern over the 
lack of proper premises and inadequate staff in 
labour and industrial courts and a proper office 
only can ensure their smooth functioning. So, both 
I and III are implicit. The lack of facilities to the 
courts also indicates the state’s negligent attitude 
to the condition of the courts. So, II is also implicit.

17. (b): By using Pythagoras theorem the shortest 
distance between Pole C and Pole A will be √369m. 
 
18. (d): The total distance between Pole F and Pole E will 
be 15 m. 
 
Direction (19-20): 
 
 
19. (d): Clearly D is the Paternal Grandmother of C. 
 
20. (c): Clearly B is the nephew of G. 
 
Directions (21-25): By using the given information: 
Two boxes are kept between the box of Biscuits, which is 
kept at the top and Box B, which does not contain Soaps 
and Spices. The box which contains Soaps is kept just 
below Box P. Only three boxes are kept between the box of 
Soaps and the box of Oils. Box Q is kept just below the box 
of oils. Three boxes are kept between Box A, which does not 
contain Spices and Creams and Box P, which does not 
contain Biscuits and Toffee. We have three possible cases- 
Case1, Case 2 and Case 3. 
 
 
 
 
Only two boxes are kept between box of Toffee and the box 
of Shampoo and both boxes are kept in the box above the 
box of oils. Now Case 2 and Case 3 will be eliminated.

Three boxes are kept between Box A, which does not 
contain Spices and Creams and Box P, which does not 
contain Biscuit and Toffee.  
 
Therefore, Box A contains Detergent, Box P contains 
Shampoo. As Box B does not contains spices so Box B 
contains Creams and Box Q contains Spices. 
 
Box R is kept just below the box of Detergent. Box C is kept 
above Box S but below Box T. Now we have our final 
arrangement.

Directions (26-30): By using the given information: 
Q, whose age is a multiple of 7 sits second to the left of R 
and three persons sit between R and P. Only one person sits 
between R and the one who is age is 60 years.  
 
The one whose age is 59 years sits third to the left of the 
one whose age is 60 years. Three persons sit between T, 
who is the eldest person and the one whose age is 59 years. 
S and P are immediate neighbors of each other but neither 
of them is more than 36 years old. 
 
U is not an immediate neighbor of T. W’s age is not 60 years 
and also he doesn’t sit immediate left of R. P is one year 
younger to S. W is younger to R. Now we have our final 
arrangement.

31. (d): In this question, we have to find which is not 
related to the above statement. 
 
 
For I: It is completely related to the passage, there 
must be awareness program to make society 
awake. 
 
 
For II: This is must do step which should be taken 
by Government, but it is not related to statement 
which is mention above. 
 
 
For III: It is a myth that should be avoided or 
abolished but it is the part of the statement given 
above. 
 
Directions (32-35): By using the given information: 
Only three persons are younger to B, who is a driver. The 
one who is the second oldest is Carpenter. E was born in a 
year after B but he was not born in a leap year. Only two 
persons was born between E and A. Now we have two 
possible cases i.e., Case1 and Case2.

D’s age is not 26 years. The sum of age of D and the one who 
is Doctor is 67 years. i.e. (26 + 41) years. The difference 
between the age of Nurse and the carpenter is 6 years. i.e. 
(43-37) years. A is not a Nurse. Now case1 will be 
eliminated. The sum of age the plumber and C is 62 years 
i.e., (45 + 17) years. Now we have one more case i.e., 
Case2(a). I was not born in 1984 and he is neither a 
plumber nor a carpenter, so by elimination I is a doctor.

The one whose age is 41 years is not a singer. D is neither 
an Engineer nor a Banker, so D is a Painter. The sum of age 
of Painter and Singer is 61 years. A is not an Engineer, so A 
is a banker and C is an Engineer.

Directions (36-38): By using the given information: 
The one who has the highest amount of money sits third to 
the left of V. Neither V nor the one who has highest amount 
of money sits at the corner. The immediate neighbor of the 
one who has highest money faces south direction. Three 
persons sits between the one who has Rs67 and the one 
who has the least amount of money and one of them sits at 
the right corner of the row. The one who has the least 
amount of money is not an immediate neighbor of the one 
who has the highest amount of money. V has 36ruppes. We 
have four possible cases for that. Case1, Case1(a), Case2, 
and Case2(a). 
 
 
 
The number of persons sitting to the left of V is same as the 
number of persons siting to the right of Q. Q neither have 
the highest nor the lowest amount money. Now Case1 and 
Case2(a) will be eliminated as we cannot place Q. 
 
Y does not sit near to V. Z sits third to the right of Q. Y and 
X are immediate neighbors of Z. The number of persons 
sitting between Y and V is same as the number of persons 
sitting between V and S. Now case 2 will be eliminated as 
we can’t place S, who does not face south. Immediate 
neighbor of X faces the same direction. 
 
Y and X faces the opposite direction as Z, who has 43 rupee. 
R has more money than P, who sits near to Q. X has less 
money than P. Now we have our final arrangement. 
 
 
36. (d):  
37. (e): 
38. (e): 
 
39. (e): Only argument II is strong.  
 
 
The students cannot be enrolled in the courses just 
on the basis of their interests, but their 
compatibility with the same also matters. So, I 
does not hold. Besides, lack of institutes is not 
criteria to deny post-graduate courses to students. 
So, argument III also does not hold. II provides a 
genuine reason and thus holds strong.  
 
40. (e): For I: Yes, about counterfeiting is mentioned, 
whether ban on high currency notes gets success 
in terrorism, corruption and counterfeiting. So, we 
can easily assume that Govt. was concerned about 
the counterfeiting of notes. 
 
 
For 
II: 
Yes, 
as 
according 
to 
statement 
demonetization is good or bad is a matter of 
debate, but its impact on weaker section is not 
mentioned, but if we assume it as bad we can 
consider that it has bad impact on weaker sections 
of society. 
 
 
For III: No, from statement we can conclude that 
there is revamp in tax compliance but to classify 
its increment into direct and indirect tax, it’s not 
possible to assume according to statement.

From I,  
 
 
Given, √3
4 × 𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒2= 25√3 
 
 
Side of triangle = 10 cm. 
 
 
Perimeter of triangle = 30 cm 
 
 
So, perimeter of rectangle = 30 cm 
 
 
2(8x+7x)=30 
 
 
x =1 
 
 
So, length and breadth of the rectangle is 8 cm and 
7 cm respectively. 
 
 
Area of rectangle = 8× 7 = 56 𝑐𝑚2 
 
 
From II. 
 
 
Perimeter of Square = 16 cm. 
 
 
Side of square = 4 cm. 
 
 
So, length of rectangle = 8 cm 
 
 
And breadth of rectangle = 7 cm. 
 
 
Area of rectangle = 56 cm2
