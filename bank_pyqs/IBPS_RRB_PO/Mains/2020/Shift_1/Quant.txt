From II. 
 
 
M.R.P = 750 
 
 
So, cost price = 500 
 
 
Selling price = 500+ 73.75=573.75 
 
 
Aggregate Discount = 
750−573.75
750
× 100 = 23.5% 
 
 
Either I or II is sufficient. 
 
49. (e): From I x + y =7 
 
 
From II. x~𝑦= 1 
 
 
So, we can’t be determined the actual value of x 
and y. 
 
50. (e): From I 
 
 
Ankit Investment share = 1600 Rs.  
 
 
Time on which Ankit Invest = 8 months  
 
 
Satish investment share = 1200 Rs.  
 
 
From II 
 
 
Given, profit share of Satish = 630 Rs.  
 
 
So, from both sentence we could not find answer, 
time period on which Satish invest his capital not 
given, so we could not determine profit ratio of 
Ankit and Satish.  
 
51. (a): Let amount invested in each scheme = Rs. x  
 
 
x×12×6
100
− 
x×8×8
100  = 1280 
 
 
⇒ 
8x
100 = 1280 
 
 
⇒ x = 16,000 Rs. 
 
52. (c): Let speed of boat in still water v km/hr 
 
 
and speed of current be r km/hr 
 
 
Speed of boat in upstream = 
11
4
11 × 60  
 
 
v– r = 15 km/hr …(i) 
 
 
⇒ 
r
r+v =
1
7 ;  
 
 
⇒ 7r = r + v ⇒ 6r = v …(ii) 
 
 
Solving eq. (i) and (ii) 
 
 
5r = 15 ⇒ r = 3 km/h 
 
 
∴ Downstream speed = 18 + 3 = 21 km/hr 
 
 
∴ Required distance = 21 ×
52
60 = 18.2 km  
 
53. (b): Let the selling price of article be Rs. 100x 
 
 
So, the marked price of article =100x ×
125
100 = 125𝑥 
Rs. 
 
 
Cost price of article =100𝑥÷ 1.25 = 𝑅𝑠 80𝑥 
 
 
ATQ 
 
 
(125x – 80) – (100x – 80x) =200 
 
 
x=8 Rs. 
 
 
Cost price of article =Rs 640 
 
 
Required selling price = 640 ×
11
8  = 880 Rs. 
 
54. (e): Let the investment of B = 25x 
 
 
So, the investment of A = 25x ×
52
100 = 13𝑥 
 
 
And let the investment of C be Rs y 
 
 
So, profit ratio of A, B & C =  
 
 
  
 
 
ATQ 
 
 
8y=2(200x-172x) 
 
 
𝑥
𝑦=
1
7  
 
 
Required percentage =
7
25 × 100 = 28%  
 
55. (b): For I-  number of plastic balls = 10 
 
 
 
ATQ, number of leather balls = 18-10 =8 
 
 
 
So, desired probability =10c1×8c1 /18c2 =80/153 
 
 
 
So, I can be answer. 
 
 
For II-  number of plastic balls = 8 
 
 
 
ATQ, number of leather balls = 18-8=10 
 
 
 
So, desired probability =8c1×10c1/18c2 = 80/153 
 
 
 
So, II cannot be answer. 
 
 
For III-  number of plastic balls = 6 
 
 
 
ATQ, number of leather balls = 18-6 =12 
 
 
 
So, desired probability =6c1×12c1/18c2 = 8/17 
 
 
 
So, III can be answer. 
 
56. (d): Total people who have under graduate degree 
from C & D 
 
 
= 6000 ×
28
100 −880 + 6000 ×
25
100 −700 
 
 
= 800 + 800= 1600 
 
 
Total illiterate people from A & E

50
50 
 
 
= 480 + 1200 = 1680 
 
 
Required ratio = 
1600
1680 = 20 ∶21 
 
57. (d): Required angle = 
500+700
440+500+880+700+360 × 360 
 
 
=
1200
2880 × 360 = 150° 
 
58. (e): Total literate people from C = 6000 ×
28
100 = 1680 
 
 
Let total males = 4x 
 
 
And, total number of females = 3x 
 
 
Total population of C = 6000 ×
28
100 ×
100
80 = 2100 
 
 
Total females in C = 2100 ×
3𝑥
7𝑥= 900 
 
 
And, total males in C = 2100 ×
4𝑥
7𝑥= 1200 
 
 
Total literate females from C = 900 ×
80
100 = 720 
 
 
Total literate males from C = 1680 – 720 = 960 
 
 
Total females have post graduate degree from C 
 
 
= 880 – 960 ×
50
100 = 400 
 
 
So total number of females who are literate but do 
not have post graduate degree from C  
 
 
= 720 – 400 = 320

So, total weight of class= 20N 
 
 
When two persons include  
 
 
Total weight of class= 22(N + 2) 
 
 
Weight of two persons included = 2N + 44 
 
 
4 persons excluded weight

younger son’s age is 20x, 3y, 9x and y respectively. 
 
 
ATQ, 
 
 
9x – y = 6 …(i) 
 
 
20x + 3y + 9x + y = 26.5 × 4 …(ii) 
 
 
Solving (i) & (ii) 
 
 
x = 2  
 
 
y = 12 
 
 
his wife’s age = 12 × 3 = 36  
 
65. (e): Let the quantity of liquid P be 4x in mixture  
 
 
So, quantity of liquid Q = 4x ×

71. (d): Let the total no. of students in 2015 and 2017 be 
4x and 5x respectively. 
 
 
Given (4𝑥×

100 −5𝑥×
30

x=1800 
 
 
then no. of banking students in 2017= 9000 ×

100 = 3240 
 
 
no. of banking students in 2015  
 
 
= 7200 ×

Difference =(3240-2016)=1224

As it can be seen that in 2018 the no. of Railway 
student was third highest. 
 
73. (d): Let total no. of students in 2015,2016,2017,2018 
be a, b, c ,d respectively 
 
 
For 2015,  
 
 
no. of Railway students = a ×
40
100 = 0.4a 
 
 
average of Banking and SSC students 
 
 
=
0.28𝑎+0.32𝑎
2
= 0.3𝑎  
 
 
For 2016, 
 
 
no. of Railway students = a ×
30
100 = 0.3a 
 
 
average of Banking and SSC students 
 
 
=
0.42𝑎+0.28𝑎
2
= 0.35𝑎  
 
 
For 2017, 
 
 
no. of Railway students = a ×
30
100 = 0.3a 
 
 
average of Banking and SSC students 
 
 
=
0.36𝑎+0.34𝑎
2
= 0.35𝑎  
 
 
For 2018  
 
 
no. of Railway students = a ×
25
100 = 0.25a 
 
 
average of Banking and SSC students 
 
 
=
0.30+0.45𝑎
2
= 0.375𝑎  
 
 
So, there is one year i.e. 2015 in which no. of 
Railway students is more than average of Banking 
and SSC students together. 
 
74. (c): Let the total no. of students be x for all of the given 
year, then 
 
 
For 2015 
 
 
Difference between Railway and SSC students 
 
 
= (0.4𝑥−0.32𝑥) = 0.08𝑥 
 
 
For 2016 
 
 
Difference between Railway and SSC students 
 
 
= (0.30𝑥−0.28𝑥) = 0.02𝑥 
 
 
For 2017 
 
 
Difference between Railway and SSC students 
 
 
= (0.34𝑥−0.30𝑥) = 0.04𝑥 
 
 
For 2018 
 
 
Difference between Railway and SSC students 
 
 
= (0.45𝑥−0.25𝑥) = 0.20𝑥 
 
 
As it can be seen that difference between no. of 
Railway students and SSC students is second 
lowest is in 2017. 
 
75. (e): Let the total no. of students in 2018 be x  
 
 
Then ATQ 
 
 
(. 45𝑥−.30𝑥) = 300 
 
 
X=2000 and no. of Railway students in 2018 = 500 
 
 
So, no. of Railway students in 2015 and 2017 will 
be 600 and 300 respectively 
 
 
So, no. of SSC students in 2015= (
600
40 × 32) = 480 
 
 
no. of SSC students in 2017= (
300
30 × 34) = 340 
 
 
average no. of SSC students in 2015 and 2017 
together=
480+340
2
= 410
