95. (a): The correct answer is option a. 
 
 
The error lies in part ‘a’ of the sentence. 
 
 
Remove “Will” after ‘When’. Usage of ‘Will’ after 
conjunctions referring to future time is incorrect. 
 
 
In the given sentence, we use “When” as a 
conjunction introducing a time clause thus, usage 
of ‘Will’ is inappropriate. So the correct phrase will 
be “when Smita finds”. 
 
96. (b): The correct answer is option b. 
 
 
The error lies in the part ‘b’ of the sentence. 
 
 
Use article ‘A’ before the word ‘Minimum’ to make

Photography - the art or process of producing 
images by the action of radiant energy and 
especially light on a sensitive surface (such as film 
or an optical sensor). 
 
 
Whereas, Photograph - A picture or likeness 
obtained by photography. 
 
 
As 
per 
the 
context, 
usage 
of the 
noun 
‘Photography’ is grammatically & contextually 
correct. Hence, option ‘b’ is the correct choice. 
 
98. (b): The correct answer is option b. 
 
 
The error lies in part ‘b’ of the sentence. 
 
 
The proper construction is ‘To forget him 
completely’. 
 
 
After ‘TO’ it will take an infinitive form of the verb 
‘Forget’ and not an adverb ‘Completely’.
