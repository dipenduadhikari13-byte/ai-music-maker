Directions (81-88): Read the following passage and answer the following questions. Some words 
are highlighted to help you answer some of the questions.  
 
Electricity consumption has been growing rapidly in spite of serious supply constraints caused by delays 
in implementing new capacity additions, lower utilization of existing capacity due to maintenance 
problems, coal and oil availability, and drought conditions, which simultaneously reduced hydro energy 
availability and increased agricultural demand for lift irrigation. Global electricity consumption has 
continued to go up rapidly at a rate faster than energy consumption. Between 1980 and 2013, the world’s 
annual electricity consumption rose from 7300 TWh to 22,100 TWh. Emerging economies in Asia and 
Central and South America have witnessed far more significant growth of electric power consumption 
compared to the developed regions. North America and Europe experienced growth of electric power 
consumption by 87 and 148%, respectively, far lower compared to growth in the emerging and developing 
economies. Electricity consumption in Sweden can be divided into three principal categories, the 
percentage shares of which, out of the total electricity consumption, have changed since the beginning of 
the 1950s. This trend has since continued but the development has also been affected by the business 
recession which has characterized the industry in the last few years. 
For industry, there is a strong connection between production volume and electricity consumption. As a 
basis for a prognosis of electricity consumption of the industry, the estimation by industry of the 
development of production volume and the specific electricity consumption is necessary. A characteristic 
feature, in the judgment of the industries, is that the uncertainty rapidly increases with the time 
perspective. In order to pay attention to this uncertainty in the best way, an average prognosis with a 
dispersion belonging to it is used in planning. As far as industry is concerned there is a special problem in 
the business variations. In forecasting, it is desirable to separate the variations in season and business from 
the long-term trend. Prognoses made in boom years can otherwise easily become too optimistic, whilst 
prognoses made during a recession period may be colored by this and become too low. Annual electricity 
consumption per capita serves as an important ____________(A)_____________ of a country’s electric power 
development. Generally speaking, electricity consumption grows faster when the industrialization process 
develops quickly and goes down rapidly when industrialization is completed or near completion.

The United Kingdom saw rising electricity consumption per capita between World War II and the mid-
1970s, driven by faster economic growth. In the 1970s and 1980s when the economy slowed, per capita 
electricity consumption growth went down as well. The other large main group, other consumption, has 
had a more even growth over many years. This group comprises, inter alia, household, trade and public 
consumption. The basis for an electricity consumption prognosis in this sector primarily consists of 
prognoses of population development, dwelling construction and specific consumption in which the 
saturation degree for different types of electric apparatus is included. The load variations over the 24 
hours are of great importance for the peak power demand. Along with the increase of the total electricity 
consumption, there is a simultaneous proportional growth in the load variations. This makes short-term 
regulation gradually more expensive. In the long run, the power producers will face the choice of building 
special regulating power, for instance, pumped storage power, or measures directed at the consumers in 
order to reduce the variations in load.
