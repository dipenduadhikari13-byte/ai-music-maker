Directions (46-50): Read the following passage and answer the following questions. 
During the Covid-19 pandemic, businesses faced significant challenges, with two major issues taking the forefront: 
disruptions in the supply chain and rising inflation, a concern that heightened in the spring of 2021. 
The pandemic, causing isolation measures, led to unpredictable shifts in demand for goods and services, impacting 
global supply chains. Ports clogged up, truck driver shortages worsened, and companies struggled to secure raw 
materials, particularly affecting small businesses across the United States. 
As inflation rose due to increased interest rates, it remained a persistent issue. The U.S. Census Bureau tracked its 
impact on businesses through two surveys: the Small Business Pulse Survey (SBPS) and the more recent Business 
Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS). These surveys provided real-time insights into the challenges businesses faced. 
The SBPS, published weekly, revealed that by May 2021, 29.4% of small businesses experienced domestic supplier 
delays, rising to 35.8% by May 2021. Foreign supplier delays also increased to 19.2% over the course of the survey. 
The BTOS, starting in July 2022, continued tracking supply chain issues. In the initial phase, 36.1% of small 
businesses reported domestic supplier delays and 13% faced foreign supplier delays. However, the most recent 
data from July 2023 showed significant improvements. Domestic supplier delays dropped to 14.5%, and foreign 
supplier delays decreased to 4.3%.

information, showcasing the evolving challenges businesses encountered during the pandemic.

pandemic, according to the passage? 
(a) Small businesses faced operational disruptions due to challenges in the supply chain.  
(b) The increased cost of operations caused by inflation disrupted the management of the supply chain. (c) Small 
businesses experienced delays in delivering essential goods. 
(d) The infrastructure and smooth operation were impacted by a high demand for truck drivers. 
(e) Obtaining real-time information and maintaining logistics proved challenging during the pandemic for small 
businesses. 
 
Q47.  According to the passage, which of the following statement is TRUE? 
(a) Small businesses in the United States were unaffected by the disruptions in the supply chain during the Covid-
19 pandemic. 
(b) The U.S. Census Bureau only tracked the impact of inflation on large businesses. 
(c) The Small Business Pulse Survey (SBPS) was initiated in July 2022 to track supply chain issues. 
(d) The SBPS, published weekly, tracked the impact of inflation on businesses through real-time insights. 
(e) The Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS) showed a decrease in domestic and foreign supplier delays 
from the initial phase in July 2022 to the most recent data in July 2023. 
 
Q48. According to the passage, which of the following statement is TRUE? 
(a) The BTOS started tracking supply chain issues in May 2021.  
(b) Inflation impacted the logistical operations during pandemic. 
(c) The SBPS revealed that foreign supplier delays increased to 29.4% by May 2021.
