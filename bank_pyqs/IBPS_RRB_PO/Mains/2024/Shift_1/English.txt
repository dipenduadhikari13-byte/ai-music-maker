Directions (147-151): Read the following passage, and answer the given questions. 
In the modern era, nations worldwide are striving for rapid economic growth, measured largely by Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP). A higher GDP is often equated with improved living standards, greater employment opportunities, and 
technological advancement. However, the race for GDP growth frequently comes at the cost of environmental 
sustainability, contributing to rising global temperatures and climate instability. 
Economic growth, especially in developing nations, often relies on industrialization, deforestation, and the exploitation of 
natural resources. These activities, while boosting GDP, release vast amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, 
accelerating global warming. As temperatures rise, the adverse effects on the environment become more pronounced—
melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and increasingly severe weather events. This, in turn, threatens long-term economic 
stability, as natural disasters can disrupt industries, displace communities, and strain resources. 
The challenge for governments is finding a balance between GDP growth and environmental protection. Sustainable 
development models are gaining traction, emphasizing green technologies, renewable energy sources, and eco-friendly 
practices that reduce carbon footprints. Investing in renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, can drive economic 
growth while mitigating the harmful effects of fossil fuel consumption. These industries not only __________________ to GDP 
but also help combat the global climate crisis. 
26 

 
Moreover, many economists argue that GDP, as a metric, should evolve to account for environmental degradation and 
social well-being. Some propose integrating "green GDP," which factors in the economic costs of environmental harm and 
promotes more sustainable development practices. 
Ultimately, the future of global economic growth depends on how well nations can align GDP development with climate-
conscious policies to ensure both economic prosperity and environmental resilience. 
 
Q147. Which of the following is the primary trade-off mentioned in the passage between economic growth and 
the environment? 
(a) Economic growth increases biodiversity as industries plant trees to counteract deforestation. 
(b) Economic growth reduces employment as automation minimizes environmental damage. 
(c) Economic growth raises GDP but often harms the environment through resource depletion. 
(d) Economic growth lowers greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging low-carbon technologies. 
(e) Economic growth and environmental impact are unrelated, allowing both goals to be pursued independently. 
 
Q148. What can be inferred about the future relationship between developed and developing nations regarding 
climate-conscious policies? 
(a) Developed nations will continue to grow economically without needing to adopt climate-conscious policies, as they 
have already established industrial dominance. 
(b) Developing nations will likely adopt climate-conscious policies faster than developed nations, as they need these 
policies for short-term industrial growth. 
(c) Developed and developing nations will collaborate equally on climate-conscious policies to ensure mutual economic 
benefits and environmental protection. 
(d) Developing nations will have no impact on global climate policies, as their economies are too small to contribute 
significantly to climate change. 
(e) Developed nations may have more resources to adopt climate-conscious policies, while developing nations could 
struggle due to their reliance on traditional industrialization for economic growth. 
 
Q149. Why might relying solely on traditional GDP as a measure of economic growth be problematic according to 
the passage? 
(a) Traditional GDP overlooks technological advancements that improve sustainability and efficiency. 
(b) GDP emphasizes short-term gains, ignoring factors like population growth and urbanization. 
(c) GDP excludes environmental costs like pollution, resource depletion, and climate change. 
(d) Traditional GDP suits developed nations but doesn't reflect environmental impacts in developing countries. 
(e) GDP includes environmental degradation but downplays the role of technology in growth. 
 
Q150. Based on the passage, what might be the primary reason that some countries resist adopting climate-
conscious policies? 
(a) These policies are viewed as too expensive to implement and may slow down short-term economic growth. 
(b) Climate-conscious policies require highly advanced technologies that most countries do not have. 
(c) Countries believe that their contributions to climate change are minimal and do not justify drastic changes. 
(d) Climate-conscious policies are difficult to enforce, and nations prefer to focus on traditional industries. 
(e) These policies are only necessary for developed nations and irrelevant to developing economies.

Directions (155-160): Read the following passage and answer the questions given below.  
Given that sleeves can make or break a garment, it’s surprising that there isn’t much India-specific information available 
on the __________________________________ of what, designer Neeta Lulla calls, “one of the pillars of a piece of clothing”. In her 
career of 40 years, Lulla has worked as a costume designer for about 400 films, from Lamhe (1991) to Devdas (2002) and 
Thalaivii (2021). Sleeves are what “haldi (turmeric) and dhaniya (coriander)” are to food, she says. “When it comes to the 
evolution of sleeves in India, much of the influence has come from the West,” says Lulla. “Traditionally, we mostly had slim 
sleeves with motifs and symbols.” Why is sleeve mania in vogue? “Fashion moves in a cyclical way so we are seeing all 
kinds of sleeves right now,” replies Lulla. “But you can’t forget their functional aspect.” 
In fashion, nothing is ever just fashion. Each aspect of a garment serves a purpose. In many versions of the abaya, for 
example, the sleeves are comfortably bell shaped so the outfit becomes more airy. “Traditionally, European clothes had a 
strong presence of heavy cuffs and power shoulders to provide protection from the weather,” Rimple offers another 
example. 
During the 1500s and 1600s, puff sleeves became famous because of their “cosmetic” use. “The Elizabethan and Victorian 
eras saw the emergence of puff sleeves. Women would wear corsets to get tiny waists, and when big sleeves were added, 
they made the person look even smaller and achieve that perfect hourglass shape. Then you had the Edwardian sleeves 
that were romantic with ruffles and lace,” explains Lulla. She explains how she used three-quarter, puff sleeves in the 
romance-drama Lamhe to give Sridevi’s character Pallavi a soft, feminine and youthful look. “This (the Renaissance 
period) was the time when women’s fashion, especially sleeves, was at the forefront.” 
The same puff sleeves became a trend in 1950s India when the country’s cinema was taking shape, hence influencing 
popular culture. “India had recently gained independence from Britain and the presence of Edwardian sleeves was 
everywhere, especially in Kolkata (since it had been one of the leading cities in British times),” says Lulla, who has been 
studying sleeves for decades.

Sol.  Let's break down the paragraph sentence by sentence and identify grammatical errors. 
Detailed Analysis: 
1. "Russia’s geopolitical pivot too Asia, particularly in light of global shifts, marks a strategic realignment with 
key regional players, especially India." 
o 
Error: "too" should be "to" because "to" is a preposition indicating direction or relation, while "too" means "also." 
o 
Correction: "Russia’s geopolitical pivot to Asia, particularly in light of global shifts, marks a strategic realignment with 
key regional players, especially India." 
2. "Strengthen ties with India offers Russia opportunities for economic collaboration, technology transfer, and 
energy partnerships." 
o 
Error: "Strengthen" should be "Strengthening" to match the subject-verb agreement. A gerund ("Strengthening") 
should be used here because it acts as the subject of the sentence. 
o 
Correction: "Strengthening ties with India offers Russia opportunities for economic collaboration, technology 
transfer, and energy partnerships." 
3. "This pivot comes as Russia seeks to diversify it’s international relations amid growing tensions with the 
West." 
59 

 
o 
Error: "it’s" is incorrect because "it’s" is a contraction for "it is" or "it has." The possessive form "its" should be used 
here to indicate possession. 
o 
Correction: "This pivot comes as Russia seeks to diversify its international relations amid growing tensions with the 
West." 
4. "The evolving dynamics among the two nations underscore the importance of their role in shaping Asia’s 
geopolitical landscape." 
o 
Error: "among" is incorrect because it is used for three or more entities. Since we are talking about two nations, 
"between" should be used instead. 
o 
Correction: "The evolving dynamics between the two nations underscore the importance of their role in shaping Asia’s 
geopolitical landscape." 
Final Answer: 
There are four errors in the paragraph: 
1. "too" → "to" 
2. "Strengthen" → "Strengthening" 
3. "it’s" → "its" 
4. "among" → "between" 
Thus, the correct answer is (d) Four errors. 
Grammar Explanation: 
• 
Preposition: "to" is a preposition indicating direction, while "too" is an adverb meaning "also" or "excessively." 
• 
Gerund: The gerund form ("-ing") is needed when the verb serves as the subject of the sentence. 
• 
Possessive vs Contraction: "its" is the possessive form; "it’s" is a contraction for "it is" or "it has." 
• 
Between vs Among: "Between" is used for two entities, while "among" is used for more than two entities. 
 
S122. Ans.(b) 
Sol.  Let's analyze the paragraph sentence by sentence and identify any grammatical errors. 
Detailed Analysis: 
1. "India's evolving security challenges, both internal as well as external, necessitate a comprehensive 'National 
Security Strategy.'" 
o 
Error: "both internal as well as external" is redundant. The correct phrasing should be either "both internal and 
external" or "internal as well as external." 
o 
Correction: "India's evolving security challenges, both internal and external, necessitate a comprehensive 'National 
Security Strategy.'" 
2. "As regional dynamics shift and new threats such as cyber warfare, terrorism, and border tensions emerge, a 
cohesive strategy would helps streamline the country’s defense, intelligence, and diplomatic efforts." 
o 
Error: "helps" should be "help" to correctly match the modal verb "would." Modal verbs like "would" are followed by 
the base form of the verb. 
o 
Correction: "a cohesive strategy would help streamline the country’s defense, intelligence, and diplomatic efforts." 
3. "This framework would guide decision-making, ensuring that national interests are protected across military, 
economic, and technological domains."

4. "Additionally, it would enable India to proactively address security risks, enhance preparedness, and 
strengthen collaborations with global allies, ultimately safeguarding its sovereignty and promoting regional 
stability." 
o 
No error in this sentence. 
Final Answer: 
There are two errors in the paragraph: 
1. "both internal as well as external" → "both internal and external" 
2. "helps" → "help" 
Thus, the correct answer is (b) Two errors. 
Grammar Explanation: 
• 
Redundancy: "both internal as well as external" is redundant because "both" and "as well as" serve similar purposes 
in this context. It should be simplified to "both internal and external." 
• 
Base form of verb after modal: After modal verbs like "would," the base form of the verb ("help") is used instead of 
"helps."

S123. Ans.(c) 
Sol.  Let's analyze the paragraph sentence by sentence and identify any grammatical errors. 
Detailed Analysis: 
1. "NITI Aayog recent unveiled the 'Greening and Restoration of Wasteland with Agroforestry' (GROW) report, 
highlighting the potential of agroforestry to rejuvenate India’s vast wastelands." 
o 
Error: "recent" should be "recently" because the adverb "recently" modifies the verb "unveiled." 
o 
Correction: "NITI Aayog recently unveiled the 'Greening and Restoration of Wasteland with Agroforestry' (GROW) 
report, highlighting the potential of agroforestry to rejuvenate India’s vast wastelands." 
2. "The report emphasizes the role of agroforestry in enhancing biodiversity, improve soil health, and 
supporting sustainable livelihoods for rural communities." 
o 
Error: "improve" should be "improving" to maintain parallel structure with "enhancing" and "supporting." The list of 
activities should have consistent verb forms. 
o 
Correction: "The report emphasizes the role of agroforestry in enhancing biodiversity, improving soil health, and 
supporting sustainable livelihoods for rural communities." 
3. "It propose a multi-sectoral approach, involving government agencies, private sector, and local communities, 
to transform barren lands into productive ecosystems." 
o 
Error: "propose" should be "proposes" because the subject "It" is singular and requires the third-person singular verb 
form. 
o 
Correction: "It proposes a multi-sectoral approach, involving government agencies, private sector, and local 
communities, to transform barren lands into productive ecosystems." 
4. "The GROW initiative is part of India’s broader strategy to combat climate change, increase carbon 
sequestration, and meet its land restoration commitments under international environmental agreements." 
o 
No error in this sentence. 
Final Answer: 
There are three errors in the paragraph: 
1. "recent" → "recently" 
2. "improve" → "improving" 
3. "propose" → "proposes" 
Thus, the correct answer is (c) Three errors. 
Grammar Explanation: 
• 
Adverb vs Adjective: "recently" is the correct adverb form to modify the verb "unveiled." 
• 
Parallel structure: In a list of actions, all verbs should have the same form. Here, "improving" needs to match 
"enhancing" and "supporting." 
• 
Subject-verb agreement: The singular subject "It" requires the singular verb "proposes," not the plural "propose." 
 
S124. Ans.(a) 
Sol.  Let's analyze the paragraph sentence by sentence and identify any grammatical errors. 
Detailed Analysis: 
1. "Learning languages offers numerous cognitive, cultural, and social benefits, making it a vital skill in today’s 
interconnected world." 
o 
No error in this sentence. 
2. "It enhances problem-solving abilities, improves memory, and boosts multitasking skills by engaging

o 
No error in this sentence. 
5. "Ultimate, learning languages broadens perspectives, empowering individuals to connect with diverse 
communities and navigate the global landscape more effectively." 
o 
Error: "Ultimate" should be "Ultimately" because an adverb is needed to modify the whole sentence, not the adjective 
"ultimate." 
61 

 
o 
Correction: "Ultimately, learning languages broadens perspectives, empowering individuals to connect with diverse 
communities and navigate the global landscape more effectively." 
Final Answer: 
There is only one error in the paragraph: 
1. "Ultimate" → "Ultimately" 
Thus, the correct answer is (a) Only one error. 
Grammar Explanation: 
• 
Adverb vs Adjective: "Ultimately" is the correct adverb form to modify the entire sentence. The adjective "ultimate" 
is incorrect in this context because it refers to something being the final or most important, while "ultimately" means 
"in the end" or "finally," which fits the intended meaning here. 
 
S125. Ans.(b) 
Sol.  The correct answer is option (b) EDBCA because this sequence arranges the sentence in a coherent and 
grammatically correct way. Here's the explanation:

• 
Part (D): "ramping up their digital" follows logically, explaining what the institutions are doing—improving their 
digital processes.

The rearranged sentence is: "Financial institutions are ramping up their digital onboarding processes, simplifying 
the loan application and approval journey for customers." 
This makes option (b) EDBCA the correct answer. 
 
S126. Ans.(d) 
Sol.  The correct answer is option (d) ACBED because this sequence arranges the sentence in a grammatically correct and 
coherent way. Here's the explanation: 
•

• 
Part (C): "celebrated on the 24th of" continues by specifying when this day is observed.

The rearranged sentence is: "International Self-Care Day is celebrated on the 24th of July each year to emphasize 
the importance of self-care and self-love." 
This makes option (d) ACBED the correct answer. 
 
S127. Ans.(a) 
Sol.  The correct answer is option (a) CDBEA because this sequence arranges the sentence in a grammatically correct and 
meaningful way. Here's the explanation:

that it refers to something.

S128. Ans.(c) 
Sol.  The correct answer is option (c) DEABC because this sequence arranges the sentence in a logical and grammatically 
correct way. Here's the explanation: 
• 
Part (D): "‘Doctors and handwriting’ often refers to" starts the sentence by introducing the subject, which is the 
stereotype about doctors' handwriting. 
• 
Part (E): "the stereotype that doctors have illegible" follows naturally, explaining what the stereotype is—that doctors 
are known for illegible handwriting. 
• 
Part (A): "handwriting, particularly in prescriptions and" continues by specifying where this illegible handwriting is 
most commonly seen—in prescriptions and medical notes. 
• 
Part (B): "medical notes, which can sometimes lead to" adds more detail, explaining that this illegibility can lead to 
certain problems. 
• 
Part (C): "misunderstandings or errors in patient care" completes the sentence by describing the potential 
consequences of illegible handwriting. 
The rearranged sentence is: "‘Doctors and handwriting’ often refers to the stereotype that doctors have illegible 
handwriting, particularly in prescriptions and medical notes, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or 
errors in patient care." 
This makes option (c) DEABC the correct answer. 
 
S129. Ans.(a) 
Sol.  The most appropriate connector to combine the sentences into a coherent and grammatically correct sentence is 
"and." 
Explanation: 
• 
"And" connects two actions that are sequentially related in the sentence: first, the manager reviewed the proposal, 
and then she approved it after discussing some minor modifications. 
• 
"In addition to" and "likewise" are not suitable as they suggest an additive or comparative relationship, which is not 
the intended context here. 
Thus, the correct answer is: 
(a) only (i) 
The sentence would read: 
The manager reviewed the proposal, and she approved it after discussing some minor modifications. 
Summary: 
• 
and adds two related actions, making it the correct connector. 
• 
in addition to adds separate points, which doesn't apply. 
• 
likewise compares similar actions, but these actions aren't comparable, they're sequential.

S140. Ans.(d) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (d): aims, laundering, confiscation, along. 
Original Sentence: "The PMLA, 2002, goals to prevent money picking and provides for the annex of property obtained 
through or involved in money laundering, among with addressing related issues." 
Analyzing the highlighted words: 
1. "Goals": 
o 
The word "goals" here is a noun, but the sentence requires a verb that indicates intent or purpose. The correct verb 
should be "aims" because "aims" means having a specific target or purpose, which fits the context. 
2. "Picking": 
o 
The phrase "money picking" does not make sense in the context of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). 
The correct term should be "laundering," which refers to the illegal process of making large amounts of money 
generated by a criminal activity appear to have come from a legitimate source. 
3. "Annex": 
o 
The word "annex" is incorrect here. The correct term should be "confiscation," which means the action of seizing 
property, especially by the government, which is appropriate in the context of dealing with illegally acquired property. 
4. "Among": 
o 
The phrase "among with" is incorrect. The correct phrase should be "along with," which means in addition to 
something else, making it grammatically and contextually correct. 
Now, considering all these corrections, let's look at the options: 
• 
(a) plans, cleaning, acquisition, amidst: Incorrect because "plans," "cleaning," and "amidst" are incorrect 
replacements. 
• 
(b) attempts, purging, seizure, besides: Incorrect because "purging" and "besides" do not fit the context. 
• 
(c) intends, bleeping, looting, amongst: Incorrect because "bleeping" and "looting" are not contextually appropriate. 
• 
(d) aims, laundering, confiscation, along: Correct. All the words are appropriate replacements in terms of meaning 
and context. 
Corrected sentence: 
The PMLA, 2002, aims to prevent money laundering and provides for the confiscation of property obtained through or 
involved in money laundering, along with addressing related issues.  
 
S141. Ans.(b) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (b): allows, to, seeking, for. 
Original Sentence: "General Consent authority the CBI in conduct investigations in a state without searching permission 
with each case." 
Analyzing the highlighted words: 
1. "Authority": 
o 
The word "authority" as a noun is inappropriate here. The correct verb should be "allows" or "enables" to express 
that the General Consent gives the CBI the ability to conduct investigations. In this context, "allows" is more suitable 
because it directly indicates permission or approval for action. 
2. "In": 
o 
The preposition "in" is not correct here. It should be "to" because the CBI is allowed to conduct investigations. 
3. "Conduct": 
o 
"Conduct" is correct and doesn't need replacement. 
4. "Searching": 
o 
The word "searching" is incorrect. The appropriate word is "seeking" because it refers to asking for permission, not 
physically searching. 
5. "With": 
o 
The preposition "with" is incorrect here. The correct preposition is "for" as it refers to seeking permission for each 
case. 
Now, considering all these corrections, let's look at the options: 
• 
(a) enables, on, executing, from: Incorrect. "On," "executing," and "from" do not fit the context. 
• 
(b) allows, to, seeking, for: Correct. All the replacements fit grammatically and contextually. 
• 
(c) empowers, at, demanding, by: Incorrect. "At" and "demanding" do not work in the sentence. 
• 
(d) approves, for, requiring, on: Incorrect. "Approves" and "requiring" are not the right replacements. 
Corrected sentence: 
General Consent allows the CBI to conduct investigations in a state without seeking permission for each case.

S142. Ans.(a) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (a): signing, between, enhance, strengthen. 
Original Sentence: "The signature of the BIT among India and Uzbekistan nations will upgrades economic cooperation 
and deep the investment environment." 
Analyzing the highlighted words: 
1. "Signature": 
o 
The word "signature" is incorrect in this context because it refers to a physical act of signing rather than the formal 
process or agreement itself. "Signing" is more appropriate because it refers to the action of formally agreeing to a 
treaty or agreement. 
2. "Among": 
o 
"Among" is incorrect because it is used when referring to more than two entities. Since the sentence refers to only two 
countries, the correct preposition should be "between." 
3. "Upgrades": 
o 
The verb "upgrades" is incorrect here because "will" should be followed by the base form of a verb. "Enhance" is the 
appropriate base form, meaning to improve or increase in value. 
4. "Deep": 
o 
The word "deep" is incorrect here because it is an adjective, but we need a verb. The correct verb is "strengthen," 
meaning to make something stronger or more effective, which fits the context of improving the investment 
environment. 
Now, considering all these corrections, let's look at the options: 
• 
(a) signing, between, enhance, strengthen: Correct. All replacements fit both grammatically and contextually. 
• 
(b) registering, amongst, enrich, toughen: Incorrect. "Registering" and "amongst" are incorrect, and "toughen" 
doesn't fit. 
• 
(c) subscribing, amidst, better, fortify: Incorrect. "Subscribing" and "amidst" are incorrect. 
• 
(d) inking, through, improve, intensity: Incorrect. "Inking" and "through" don't work here, and "intensity" is not a 
verb. 
Corrected sentence: 
The signing of the BIT between India and Uzbekistan nations will enhance economic cooperation and strengthen the 
investment environment. 
 
S143. Ans.(c) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (c): effect, approved, including, members. 
Original Sentence: "The amendment takes affect for all UN members when affirm by two-thirds of the General Assembly 
and ratified by two-thirds of UN members, exclusive all permanent Security Council member." 
Analyzing the highlighted words: 
1. "Affect": 
o 
The phrase "takes affect" is incorrect. The word "affect" is a verb, meaning to influence. Here, we need a noun. 
The correct word is "effect," which means the result of a change. 
2. "Affirm": 
o 
The word "affirm" is incorrect in this context. It needs to be in a passive form to match the structure of the 
sentence. The correct word should be "approved" because it fits with the idea of formal approval in the context 
of the General Assembly. 
3. "Exclusive": 
o 
The word "exclusive" does not fit here. The correct word should be "including" because the sentence should 
convey that the amendment involves the permanent Security Council members. 
4. "Member": 
o 
The noun "member" should be pluralized to "members" since it refers to more than one permanent Security 
Council member. 
Now, considering all these corrections, let's look at the options: 
• 
(a) affect, confirmed, excluding, member: Incorrect, as "affect" and "excluding" are wrong. 
• 
(b) effects, confirm, except, countries: Incorrect, as “effects”, "confirm" and "except" do not fit well. 
• 
(c) effect, approved, including, members: Correct. All words fit the context and are grammatically accurate. 
• 
(d) affect, verified, excluding, nations: Incorrect, "affect" and "excluding" do not work. 
Corrected sentence: 
The amendment takes effect for all UN members when approved by two-thirds of the General Assembly and ratified by 
two-thirds of UN members, including all permanent Security Council members.

Analysis: 
Sentence (I): 
"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plays a crucial role in maintaining financial stability in the country." 
Sentence (II): 
"Ensuring strict regulation of the banking sector is essential for the RBI." 
Now, let's analyze each option: 
(i) "Since the RBI plays a crucial role…" 
• 
The word "since" indicates a causal relationship. Using "since" makes the connection that the RBI's crucial role 
justifies the need for strict regulation. 
• 
Combined sentence: "Since the RBI plays a crucial role in maintaining financial stability in the country, ensuring 
strict regulation of the banking sector is essential for the RBI." 
• 
This is grammatically correct and logically sound. 
(ii) "However, the RBI plays a crucial role…" 
• 
The word "however" signals a contrast or contradiction. However, there is no contrast between the two sentences; 
both are stating positive aspects of the RBI's responsibilities. 
• 
Combined sentence: "However, the RBI plays a crucial role in maintaining financial stability in the country, 
ensuring strict regulation of the banking sector is essential for the RBI." 
• 
This does not create a logical connection because there is no contrast. Hence, this is incorrect. 
(iii) "Given that the RBI plays a crucial role…" 
• 
The phrase "Given that" establishes a condition or context for the second clause. It emphasizes that because of the 
RBI's role, certain actions must follow. 
• 
Combined sentence: "Given that the RBI plays a crucial role in maintaining financial stability in the country, 
ensuring strict regulation of the banking sector is essential for the RBI." 
• 
This is also grammatically correct and logical. 
 
S145. Ans.(c) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (c) Both (i) and (iii). 
Analysis: 
Sentence (I): 
"The Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP) is a savings scheme that aims to encourage long-term investment among farmers." 
Sentence (II): 
"The scheme guarantees a fixed return after the maturity period." 
Now, let's look at each option: 
(i) "As the Kisan Vikas Patra is a savings scheme…" 
• 
The word "as" introduces a reason or cause. In this case, it implies that because the KVP is a savings scheme, it 
guarantees a fixed return. 
• 
Combined sentence: "As the Kisan Vikas Patra is a savings scheme that aims to encourage long-term investment 
among farmers, the scheme guarantees a fixed return after the maturity period." 
• 
This is grammatically correct and logically coherent. 
(ii) "Despite being a savings scheme, the Kisan Vikas Patra…" 
• 
The word "despite" signals a contrast. However, there is no contrasting idea between sentences (I) and (II) — both 
support each other. Therefore, using "despite" does not fit in this context. 
• 
Combined sentence: "Despite being a savings scheme, the Kisan Vikas Patra guarantees a fixed return after the 
maturity period." 
• 
This creates an illogical contrast, so this is incorrect. 
(iii) "Considering the Kisan Vikas Patra is a savings scheme…" 
• 
The phrase "Considering" introduces a condition or context that justifies the second clause. It works similarly to "as," 
implying that because the KVP is a savings scheme, it guarantees a return. 
• 
Combined sentence: "Considering the Kisan Vikas Patra is a savings scheme that aims to encourage long-term 
investment among farmers, the scheme guarantees a fixed return after the maturity period." 
• 
This is grammatically correct and logical.

Analysis: 
Sentence (I): 
"Digital farming is transforming agricultural practices by integrating technology into farming operations." 
Sentence (II): 
"It enhances productivity by using data-driven insights and automation." 
Now, let's review each option: 
(i) "Since digital farming is transforming agricultural practices…" 
• 
The word "since" introduces a reason, indicating that because digital farming transforms agricultural practices, it 
enhances productivity. 
• 
Combined sentence: "Since digital farming is transforming agricultural practices by integrating technology into 
farming operations, it enhances productivity by using data-driven insights and automation." 
• 
This is grammatically correct and logically coherent. 
(ii) "Although digital farming transforms agricultural practices…" 
• 
The word "although" introduces a contrast or contradiction. However, there is no contradiction between the two 
sentences. Both sentences support each other, so "although" does not fit in this context. 
• 
Combined sentence: "Although digital farming transforms agricultural practices by integrating technology into 
farming operations, it enhances productivity by using data-driven insights and automation." 
• 
This creates an unnecessary contrast, making it incorrect. 
(iii) "Given that digital farming is transforming agricultural practices…" 
• 
The phrase "Given that" introduces a condition or context. It implies that because digital farming transforms 
agricultural practices, it enhances productivity. 
• 
Combined sentence: "Given that digital farming is transforming agricultural practices by integrating 
technology into farming operations, it enhances productivity by using data-driven insights and automation." 
• 
This is grammatically correct and logical. 
 
S147. Ans.(c) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (c) Economic growth raises GDP but often harms the environment through resource 
depletion. 
Explanation: In the passage, it is mentioned that "the race for GDP growth frequently comes at the cost of 
environmental sustainability" and "economic growth, especially in developing nations, often relies on 
industrialization, deforestation, and the exploitation of natural resources." These lines highlight that while GDP 
increases, environmental harm occurs through activities like deforestation and resource depletion. Thus, economic 
growth raises GDP but negatively affects the environment. 
Incorrect Options: 
• 
(a): There is no mention of economic growth increasing biodiversity in the passage. 
• 
(b): The passage does not claim that economic growth reduces employment or that automation plays a role in 
environmental protection. 
• 
(d): Economic growth is linked to greenhouse gas emissions in the passage, not the reduction of emissions, except in 
the context of potential future developments like renewable energy. 
• 
(e): The passage clearly links economic growth with environmental impact, stating that the two are related, and 
finding a balance is a challenge. 
 
S148. Ans.(e) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (e) Developed nations may have more resources to adopt climate-conscious policies, 
while developing nations could struggle due to their reliance on traditional industrialization for economic 
growth. 
Explanation: The passage states that "economic growth, especially in developing nations, often relies on 
industrialization, deforestation, and the exploitation of natural resources." This indicates that developing nations 
depend on traditional, resource-intensive methods for economic growth, which makes adopting climate-conscious 
policies more challenging. On the other hand, developed nations may have more resources and advanced technology to 
implement green technologies and renewable energy sources. 
 
71 

 
Incorrect Options: 
• 
(a): The passage does not suggest that developed nations can continue to grow economically without adopting 
climate-conscious policies. 
• 
(b): The passage indicates that developing nations rely on industrialization, making it less likely they would adopt 
climate-conscious policies faster than developed nations. 
• 
(c): The passage does not mention equal collaboration between developed and developing nations on climate-
conscious policies. 
• 
(d): The passage implies that developing nations do contribute to global climate issues, particularly through activities 
like deforestation and industrialization. 
 
S149. Ans.(c) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (c) GDP excludes environmental costs like pollution, resource depletion, and climate 
change. 
Explanation: The passage discusses how traditional GDP focuses on economic growth without accounting for 
environmental damage. It states that "many economists argue that GDP, as a metric, should evolve to account for 
environmental degradation and social well-being," and some propose integrating "green GDP," which would factor in the 
economic costs of environmental harm. This implies that traditional GDP overlooks environmental costs such as pollution 
and resource depletion, making it problematic when used as the sole measure of economic growth. 
Incorrect Options: 
• 
(a): The passage doesn't emphasize that GDP overlooks technological advancements related to sustainability and 
efficiency. 
• 
(b): There's no mention of GDP ignoring factors like population growth and urbanization. 
• 
(d): The passage doesn't suggest that traditional GDP only suits developed nations or excludes environmental impacts 
in developing countries. 
• 
(e): The passage argues that traditional GDP excludes environmental degradation rather than including it. 
 
S150. Ans.(a) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (a) These policies are viewed as too expensive to implement and may slow down short-
term economic growth. 
Explanation: The passage explains that economic growth, particularly in developing nations, often relies on activities like 
industrialization and resource exploitation, which boost GDP but harm the environment. It highlights the challenge for 
governments in balancing GDP growth with environmental protection, implying that adopting climate-conscious policies 
may be resisted because they could slow down short-term economic growth, especially in nations focused on traditional 
industrial methods. 
Incorrect Options: 
• 
(b): While the passage mentions renewable energy technologies, it doesn't suggest that the lack of advanced 
technologies is the main reason for resistance. 
• 
(c): There is no mention of countries believing their contributions to climate change are minimal. 
• 
(d): The passage doesn't state that climate-conscious policies are difficult to enforce. 
• 
(e): The passage makes clear that climate-conscious policies are relevant to both developed and developing nations. 
 
S151. Ans.(b) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (b) contribute. 
Explanation: In the passage, the sentence mentions industries like renewable energy that not only help combat the global 
climate crisis but also affect GDP. The word "contribute" fits best because it implies that these industries play a role in GDP 
growth. Here's the meaning of the word "contribute" and the other options in both Hindi and English: 
1. Enhance (बढ़ाना) – To improve or increase the quality, value, or extent of something. 
o 
Example: The new policy will enhance public health services.

o 
Example: The government’s new policy will stimulate economic growth. 
o 
Hindi: सरकार की नई नीदत आदथकक दवकास को प्रोत्सादहत करेगी। 
 
S152. Ans.(c) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (c) provide. Here's the explanation: 
1. In sentence (A): "The company plans to __________ training sessions to help employees develop new skills." 
o 
The word provide fits because companies typically provide (or supply) training to their employees. This means they 
are offering or making available the training sessions. 
2. In sentence (B): "To ensure everyone's participation, the teacher will __________ additional resources and study 
materials." 
o 
Again, provide is the most appropriate choice. Teachers provide (or supply) additional resources and materials to 
students. It means the teacher will make these resources available.

S153. Ans.(e) 
Sol.  The most appropriate word to fill in both blanks is (e) mitigate.  
(A) The government implemented new policies to __________ the effects of climate change on coastal communities. 
• 
The word mitigate fits because it means to reduce the severity or harmful effects of something. In this context, the 
government is trying to reduce the impact of climate change. 
(B) Wearing masks and practicing social distancing can help __________ the spread of infectious diseases. 
• 
Again, mitigate is the correct choice because wearing masks and social distancing are actions meant to lessen or 
reduce the spread of diseases. 
Meanings:

S155. Ans.(e) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (e) The enduring impact of British colonial influence shaped Indian fashion trends. 
Reference from the passage: 
1. Post-Independence Influence: The passage states: 
2. “India had recently gained independence from Britain and the presence of Edwardian sleeves was everywhere, especially 
in Kolkata (since it had been one of the leading cities in British times),” says Lulla, who has been studying sleeves for 
decades. 
This part directly links the popularity of Edwardian sleeves in India during the 1950s to the aftermath of British rule. Even 
though India had gained independence, the fashion trends in the country were still strongly influenced by the colonial era, 
especially in cities like Kolkata that had played a significant role during British rule. 
3. Fashion Trends in Cinema: The passage also mentions: 
4. “The same puff sleeves became a trend in 1950s India when the country’s cinema was taking shape, hence influencing 
popular culture.” 
Here, it’s explained that Indian cinema, which was a growing cultural force in the 1950s, adopted these Edwardian-style 
puff sleeves. Since cinema plays a large role in setting fashion trends, the presence of Edwardian sleeves in films helped 
spread their popularity throughout India. The reference to “cinema influencing popular culture” highlights that this 
fashion trend was not isolated but widespread, reaching many parts of society. 
 
74 

 
5. British Colonial Influence: 
o 
The mention of Kolkata being a key city during British rule ties the Edwardian sleeve trend to India’s colonial past. 
Kolkata, once a hub of British administrative power, had deeply embedded British cultural and fashion influences. 
o 
Lulla’s statement that Edwardian sleeves were "everywhere" during this period reinforces that the British influence 
had lingered, even though India had achieved independence a few years earlier. 
 
S156. Ans.(c) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (c) Only (II) and (III). 
Let's analyze each statement in detail with reference to the passage: 
Statement (I): 
"During the 1500s and 1600s, puff sleeves became famous because of their practical use." 
• 
Reference from the passage: The passage states: 
• 
“During the 1500s and 1600s, puff sleeves became famous because of their ‘cosmetic’ use.” 
• 
The term "cosmetic" clearly indicates that puff sleeves became famous for their visual or aesthetic appeal rather than 
for practical purposes. 
• 
Conclusion: This statement is incorrect because the passage says puff sleeves were used for cosmetic reasons, not 
practical ones. 
Statement (II): 
"Edwardian sleeves were characterized by their romantic style with ruffles and lace." 
• 
Reference from the passage: The passage states: 
• 
“Then you had the Edwardian sleeves that were romantic with ruffles and lace,” 
• 
This directly confirms the description of Edwardian sleeves as having a romantic style, with details like ruffles and 
lace. 
• 
Conclusion: This statement is correct based on the passage. 
Statement (III): 
"Puff sleeves emerged during the Elizabethan and Victorian eras." 
• 
Reference from the passage: The passage mentions: 
• 
“The Elizabethan and Victorian eras saw the emergence of puff sleeves.” 
• 
This directly supports the idea that puff sleeves first appeared during these two eras. 
• 
Conclusion: This statement is correct according to the passage. 
 
S157. Ans.(d) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (d) They combine style and purpose, offering visual appeal while also serving functional 
needs like protection and comfort. 
Reference from the passage: 
• 
Functional Aspect of Sleeves: The passage states: 
• 
“But you can’t forget their functional aspect.” 
• 
This directly points to the idea that sleeves are not just about style but also serve a functional purpose. 
• 
Comfort in Abayas: The passage provides the example of abayas: 
• 
“In many versions of the abaya, for example, the sleeves are comfortably bell-shaped so the outfit becomes more airy.” 
• 
This shows that the design of sleeves is intended to provide comfort, combining both function and style. 
• 
Protection in European Clothes: Another example in the passage is: 
• 
“Traditionally, European clothes had a strong presence of heavy cuffs and power shoulders to provide protection from 
the weather,” 
• 
Here, the design elements of sleeves and shoulders serve a practical purpose by offering protection, in addition to 
their visual style. 
Why the other options are incorrect: 
• 
(a): While design elements do contribute to the visual impact, the passage emphasizes their functional aspect as well, 
which is missing in this option. 
• 
(b): The passage does mention historical trends (like Edwardian and Victorian sleeves), but the primary purpose 
discussed is not solely drawing attention to the history of fashion. 
• 
(c): The passage focuses on both style and function. There is no emphasis on cultural or symbolic meanings being the 
main purpose behind design elements like sleeves and shoulders. 
• 
(e): There’s no mention of a deliberate attempt to create uniformity in style across geographical regions or time 
periods. In fact, the passage suggests that fashion varies across different cultures and time periods, influenced by 
different factors. 
 
75 

 
S158. Ans.(c) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (c) Sleeves are essential, and Lulla used three-quarter puff sleeves to create a soft, 
feminine, youthful look. 
Explanation: 
1. Neeta Lulla’s View on Sleeves: In the passage, Lulla expresses that sleeves are an essential part of a garment, 
comparing them to crucial ingredients in food: 
2. “Sleeves are what ‘haldi (turmeric) and dhaniya (coriander)’ are to food,” indicating their importance in creating the 
overall look of a garment. This shows that Lulla considers sleeves to be a foundational aspect of fashion design, not 
just a decorative element or something to be overlooked. 
3. How Lulla Used Sleeves in Lamhe to Enhance Pallavi’s Character: The passage states: 
4. “She explains how she used three-quarter, puff sleeves in the romance-drama Lamhe to give Sridevi’s character Pallavi a 
soft, feminine, and youthful look.” 
5. This demonstrates that Lulla carefully chose three-quarter puff sleeves to reflect Pallavi’s character traits—making 
her appear soft, feminine, and youthful in the film. 
Why other options are incorrect: 
• 
(a): The passage does not mention full-length sleeves or suggest that Lulla aimed for a sophisticated look in Lamhe. 
• 
(b): Lulla did not use puff sleeves to make Pallavi appear strong or dominant. Instead, she aimed for a soft and feminine 
look. 
• 
(d): The passage does not mention sleeveless designs for Pallavi, nor is there an emphasis on modernity in this context. 
• 
(e): Lulla does not avoid sleeves; rather, she emphasizes their importance in her designs. 
 
S159. Ans.(d) 
Sol.  The correct word to complete the blank in the passage is (d) evolution (विकास/क्रविक परििर्तन) 
Explanation: 
The passage discusses the gradual and continuous changes in the design and significance of sleeves over time. The word 
"evolution" fits both grammatically and contextually because it refers to the process of gradual development or change, 
which is appropriate when talking about how sleeves have changed over time in fashion. 
• 
Contextual Fit: The passage talks about the history of sleeves, how their styles have changed across eras and cultures, 
and how they are influenced by the West. The concept of evolution captures this ongoing, gradual transformation in 
fashion. 
• 
Grammatical Fit: "Evolution" fits grammatically as a noun, making sense in the sentence: “there isn’t much India-
specific information available on the evolution of what Neeta Lulla calls, ‘one of the pillars of a piece of clothing.’” 
Why the other options are incorrect: 
1. (a) Emerge (उभिना/प्रकट होना): This word suggests the appearance of something new, which does not reflect the 
continuous process described in the passage. 
2. (b) Transition (परििर्तन/संक्रिण): This refers to moving from one state to another, but it doesn’t capture the full 
sense of gradual development over time that "evolution" does. 
3. (c) Transformed (बदलना/रूपांर्रिर् होना): This implies a sudden or significant change, which is not the focus of the 
passage. The passage emphasizes a more gradual process. 
4. (e) Ebbing (घटाि/क्षीण होना): This word means a gradual decline, which is not the correct idea here, as the passage 
is talking about the development and ongoing changes in sleeve design, not a decline. 
Therefore, (d) evolution is the most suitable word for both the grammatical structure and the meaning in the passage. 
 
S160. Ans.(d) 
Sol.  The correct answer is (d) Only (II). 
Let's analyze each statement carefully with reference to the passage to see which ones are incorrect: 
Statement (I): 
"Lulla attributes the evolution of sleeves to Western influence." 
• 
Reference from the passage: 
• 
Lulla explicitly mentions, “When it comes to the evolution of sleeves in India, much of the influence has come from the 
West,” confirming that she does attribute the evolution of sleeves to Western influence. 
• 
Conclusion: 
• 
This statement is correct based on the passage. 
76 

 
Statement (II): 
"Traditionally, we mostly had wide sleeves with plain designs but lot of motifs." 
• 
Reference from the passage: 
• 
The passage actually states, “Traditionally, we mostly had slim sleeves with motifs and symbols,” indicating that 
traditional Indian sleeves were slim, not wide. Also, the statement in the passage highlights that there were motifs 
and symbols, not just plain designs with motifs as this statement suggests. 
• 
Conclusion: 
• 
This statement is incorrect because it misrepresents the traditional style of sleeves in India. 
Statement (III): 
"Fashion is cyclical, so we're seeing various sleeve styles now." 
• 
Reference from the passage: 
• 
Lulla mentions, “Fashion moves in a cyclical way so we are seeing all kinds of sleeves right now,” which directly confirms 
that fashion trends are cyclical, and we are seeing various sleeve styles now. 
• 
Conclusion: 
• 
This statement is correct based on the passage.
