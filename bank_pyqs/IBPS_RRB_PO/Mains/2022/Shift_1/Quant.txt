Directions (81-86): Read the given passage and answer the following questions based on that  
A popular theme at seminars this autumn is de-colonisation. The concept notes explaining the theme treat 
it like a new deodorant — much required and expected to cure a chronic problem for good. Not that earlier 
generations had ignored it, but perhaps they lacked determination and propitious circumstances. The 
urge to undo the various legacies of colonisation was always there. Why the previous struggles failed 
arouses little curiosity in today’s crusaders against the colonial mindset. As an ideology, colonialism has an 
inbuilt device to deal with reactive moods of the colonised. These moods vary according to economic and 
political seasons. Citizens of former colonies typically feel more comfortable when they are passing 
through a good phase of their collective economic life. Conversely, they get twitchy when growth slows 
down. Another mood swinger is politics. The colonial phase of history is a great political resource. In a 
multi-party system, it is easy to invoke the ghost of colonial legacy. Once aroused, the ghost performs 
reliable tricks to attract public attention. 
De-colonisation received a major official push in several African colonies after they _______________ freedom. 
In education, language was a focus area, but the choice did not prove wise. Entrenched social inequalities 
came in the way of ideal goals. In India, we have experienced this trajectory several times over, but the 
fascination of radical stances has not diminished. Removal of English is a big draw among political parties 
which promise to exorcise India’s mind, body and soul from the ghost of colonialism. Alas, among the youth, 
English shows no sign of becoming unpopular. As Snigdha Poonam has documented in her remarkable 
study of provincial youth culture, ‘spoken English’ has emerged as a major component of the coaching 
industry.
