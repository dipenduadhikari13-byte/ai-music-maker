Directions (93- 99): Read the given passage to answer the following questions.  
Globally, food and nutrition security continue to be undermined by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
climate change, spiralling food inflation, conflict, and inequality. Today, around 828 million people 
worldwide do not have enough to eat and over 50 million people are facing severe hunger. 
The Hunger Hotspots Outlook (2022-23) forebodes escalating hunger, as over 205 million people across 
45 countries will need emergency food assistance to survive. Without food and nutrition security for all, 
there can be no peace and no prosperity. Only through collective and transformational action to strengthen 
agri-food systems, rectifying storage problem, through better production, better nutrition, a better 
environment, and a better life, can we meet our promise to end hunger by 2030. 
_______________________ food production is fundamental to attaining the goal of zero hunger. India has had an 
inspiring journey towards better production and achieving self-sufficiency and is now one of the largest 
agricultural product exporters in the world. During 2021-22, the country recorded $49.6 billion in total 
agriculture exports — a 20% increase from 2020-21. However, recent climate shocks have raised concerns 
about India’s wheat and rice production over the next year. Given climate shocks and extreme weather 
phenomena, it is important to place a greater focus on climate adaptation and resilience building. 
India’s agriculture sector primarily exports agriculture and allied products, marine products, plantations, 
and textile and allied products. Rice, sugar, and spices were some of the main exports. India is also a 
provider of humanitarian food products, notably to Afghanistan, and to many other countries when the 
world faces food supply shortages and disruptions, such as during the current crisis in Ukraine. Agri-food 
systems will need to provide for and sustainably support an increasing population. In the current times, 
there is an increased recognition to move away from conventional input-intensive agriculture towards 
more inclusive, effective, and sustainable agri-food systems that would facilitate better production. 
 
Q93. Which of the following(s) is/are the assured steps to end the global hunger? 
(a) Through intensive and collaborative measures to improve agriculture-based production 
(b) By addressing the needs to improvise environment and nutrition. 
(c) Interventions to solve storage requirements

(e) All of these

Q94. Which of the information is FALSE with regarding to the data given in the passage?

(b) The Hunger Hotspots Outlook (2022-23) estimated over 200 million people in around 45 countries 
require urgent food security  
(c) It is imperative to put an end to hunger and nutrition deficiencies to achieve global peace and 
prosperity. 
(d) India saw a substantial jump of 25% in the export of the year 2021-22 comparative to its previous year. 
(e) None of these 
 
Q95. What is the condition of export in India?

(c) Rice, sugar and spices are some of the major components of Indian export
