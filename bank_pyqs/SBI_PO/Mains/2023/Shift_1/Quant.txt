Directions (144-149): Read the following passage and answer the given questions. 
In the intricate tapestry of the Middle East's economic landscape, countries face enduring challenges, and 
Portugal's ministerial predicament sheds light on the shortcomings of past economic philosophies. Two 
ministers, Maria Silva and João Rodrigues, grapple with distinct and now seemingly inadequate 
approaches, reflecting a negative tone in the quest to revive the economy. 
Maria Silva, advocating a meticulous, methodical approach, once celebrated for its practicality, finds her 
strategies faltering in the face of evolving challenges. Studying the highs and lows of the economy and 
addressing root causes was once considered a robust strategy.  
On the opposing front, João Rodrigues champions an immediate solution – the infusion of cash and 
monetary resources into the economy. This Keynesian approach, effective in the past, now reveals its flaws 
in the contemporary economic landscape. Rapid cash injections, while providing a quick fix, risk 
contributing to inflation and fail to address the deep-seated, structural issues at the heart of the economic 
challenges. 
These once-successful policies from the 1980s are now proving inadequate in the current scenario. The 
failure of Silva's methodical approach lies in its inability to swiftly adapt to the rapid changes and 
interconnectedness characterizing today's global economy. Conversely, Rodrigues' cash infusion strategy, 
while providing short-term relief, lacks the foresight needed to address the intricate challenges that have 
evolved over time. 
The inadequacy of these policies in today's scenario underscores the necessity for innovative, adaptive 
strategies that account for the complexities of modern economies. Globalization, technological 
advancements, and shifting geopolitical landscapes demand a departure from historical approaches. The 
difficulty in reviving the Middle East's economy serves as a cautionary tale, emphasizing the imperative for 
forward-thinking policies that can navigate the intricacies of the contemporary economic environment.
