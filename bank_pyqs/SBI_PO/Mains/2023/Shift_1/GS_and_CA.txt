of the fashion industry in the past.

Now, let's match the synonyms: 
The word "rigid" (i) in column (A) is synonymous with "restrictive" (iv) in column (B). 
The word "perpetuated" (ii) in column (A) is not synonymous with any word in column (B). 
The word "realm" (iii) in column (A) is not synonymous with any word in column (B).

(d) CBA 
 
S124. Ans.(b)

within the fashion industry in the past. 
(ii) Remarkable: Worthy of attention or extraordinary. In the context of the passage, it is used to describe 
the transformation undergone by the fashion industry.

(vi) Marginalized: Pushed to the edges or sidelines, treated as insignificant or less important. In the 
passage, it refers to voices that were previously overlooked or not given much importance. 
 
S125. Ans.(d) 
Sol. Refer to the lines, “Brands that champion these values resonate (M) more deeply with consumers 
who seek authenticity and representation” 
The option (d) "Brands utilize fashion as a means of connecting with their customers by embodying 
the principles of authenticity and representation" is explaining how the fashion industry facilitates a 
connection between brands and customers. 
 
S126. Ans.(d) 
Sol. Explanation: 
(I) Fashion brands can influence societal attitudes toward acceptance of differences: This statement 
aligns with the idea that the embrace of diversity and inclusivity by fashion brands can impact societal 
attitudes, fostering acceptance of differences. 
(II) Fashion brands challenge traditional norms and reinforce a broader definition of beauty and 
acceptance: This statement highlights how the fashion industry, by embracing diversity, challenges 
traditional norms and contributes to a broader definition of beauty and acceptance. 
(III) Fashion brands contribute to societal change by promoting exclusive beauty standards: This 
statement is incorrect as it contradicts the passage, which emphasizes the move away from exclusive 
beauty standards. 
(IV) Consumers may feel empowered when they see themselves represented in the fashion 
industry: This statement is consistent with the passage's notion that representation in the fashion industry 
can empower individuals.

The sentence "B" introduces the topic by stating that fast food has become a convenient option for 
individuals with busy schedules. It sets the stage for the discussion on the drawbacks and consequences of 
the popularity of fast food. 
 
S138. Ans.(c) 
Sol. The correct sequence is BACFED. 
The third sentence after the rearrangement is:(C) 
This sentence expands on the discussion about fast food by highlighting its nutritional drawbacks and the 
negative impact it has on health. 
 
S139. Ans.(a) 
Sol. The correct sequence is BACFED. 
The second sentence after the rearrangement is: (a) A 
This sentence follows the introduction in sentence (B) and presents the downside of the popularity of fast 
food, emphasizing the hidden nutritional drawbacks associated with its excessive consumption. 
 
S140. Ans.(a) 
Sol. The most suitable to replace “that” is “which”. 
Explanation 
(b) who - Incorrect. "Who" is used when referring to people, and in this context, we are discussing the 
allure of meals for individuals. 
(c) whose - Incorrect. "Whose" is a possessive pronoun and is used to show possession, which is not the 
intended meaning in this sentence. 
(d) them - Incorrect. "Them" is a pronoun for people, but it does not serve the same grammatical function 
as "which" in the context of the sentence. 
(e) whom - Incorrect. "Whom" is an object pronoun used in formal English, typically as an object of a verb 
or preposition, and it doesn't fit well in this context. 
48 

 
 
S141. Ans.(d) 
Sol. The correct sequence is BACFED. 
The fifth sentence in this arrangement is sentence (E). This sentence discusses the environmental impact 
of fast food production, highlighting concerns related to excessive packaging and waste. It adds an 
additional layer to the negative aspects associated with the consumption of fast food, emphasizing broader 
environmental concerns. 
 
S142. Ans.(e) 
Sol. The correct sequence is BACFED. 
The fourth sentence in this arrangement is sentence (F). This sentence emphasizes that while fast food 
offers convenience and time savings, it often poses a risk to the long-term health of individuals. It serves to 
underscore the negative health implications associated with the convenience of fast food. 
 
S143. Ans.(b) 
Sol. In sentence (F), the word that should fill the blank is: (b) sacrifices 
So, the completed sentence would be: "Thus, the convenience that fast food offers may save time, but it 
often jeopardizes the long-term health of individuals." 
 
S144. Ans.(c) 
Sol. Refer, to the lines, “The failure of Silva's methodical approach lies in its inability to swiftly adapt 
to the rapid changes and interconnectedness characterizing today's global economy.” 
The correct answer is: 
(c) Because it lacks the agility to quickly adjust to the dynamic changes and interconnected nature of 
today's global economy. 
Explanation: 
The passage highlights that Maria Silva's methodical approach faces challenges in the contemporary 
economic landscape because of its inability to swiftly adapt to the rapid changes and interconnectedness 
characterizing today's global economy. The methodical approach, once celebrated for its practicality, is 
now deemed inadequate in addressing the evolving challenges and complexities of the modern economic 
environment. Option (c) accurately reflects this explanation from the passage. 
 
S145. Ans.(c) 
Sol. Both the statements (II) and (III) are correct. 
Refer to the lines, “The inadequacy of these policies in today's scenario underscores the necessity for 
innovative, adaptive strategies that account for the complexities of modern economies. 
Globalization, technological advancements, and shifting geopolitical landscapes demand a 
departure from historical approaches” 
Option (II) correctly reflects the necessity mentioned in the passage – understanding the dynamic global 
economy, technological advancements, and shifting geopolitical landscapes. Option (III) accurately 
represents the idea of creating innovative and flexible strategies that consider the intricacies of present-
day economies, as stated in the passage. 
 
S146. Ans.(e) 
Sol. The passage doesn't explicitly state how Rodrigues' approach achieves a trade-off between providing 
immediate relief and ensuring long-term effectiveness. Therefore, the information given in the passage is 
not sufficient to definitively answer the question.  
49 

 
 
S147. Ans.(a) 
Sol. The statement that is INCORRECT concerning João Rodrigues' approach is: 
(I) Rapid cash injections attempt to resolve the fundamental, structural issues at the core of the economic 
challenges. 
The correct statement should reflect that rapid cash injections, according to the passage, provide short-
term relief but may not effectively address the deep-seated, structural issues at the heart of the economic 
challenges. Therefore, option (a) "Only (I)" is incorrect. 
 
S148. Ans.(b) 
Sol. Refer to the lines, “The failure of Silva's methodical approach lies in its inability to swiftly adapt 
to the rapid changes and interconnectedness characterizing today's global economy.”  
his line suggests that Maria Silva's approach, which was once practical and celebrated, is now considered 
unsuccessful. The failure is attributed to the inability of her methodical approach to quickly adapt to the 
fast-paced changes and the interconnected nature of the present-day global economy. 
“The inadequacy of these policies in today's scenario underscores the necessity for innovative, 
adaptive strategies that account for the complexities of modern economies.” 
This line reinforces the idea that the policies, including both Maria Silva's methodical approach and João 
Rodrigues' cash infusion strategy, are inadequate for the current economic conditions. It stresses the need 
for innovative and adaptive strategies that can address the complexities of modern economies. 
The passage mentions that these once-successful policies from the 1980s (referring to both Silva's and 
Rodrigues' approaches) are now proving inadequate in the current scenario, highlighting the failure of 
these approaches to adapt to the rapid changes and interconnectedness characterizing today's global 
economy. 
 
S149. Ans.(a) 
Sol. The accurate statement as per the passage is: (a) Only (I) 
(I) The inadequacy of historical policies accentuates the imperative for avant-garde strategies adept at 
navigating the intricacies of modern economies. 
The passage suggests that historical policies (referring to both Silva's and Rodrigues' approaches from the 
1980s) are now inadequate in the current economic scenario. This supports the idea that there is a need 
for innovative and adaptive strategies to navigate modern complexities. 
(II) Rodrigues' cash infusion strategy adeptly confronts the intricate challenges that have evolved over 
time. 
This statement is not accurate. The passage highlights the drawbacks of Rodrigues' cash infusion strategy, 
noting that while it provides short-term relief, it may lack the foresight to address the deep-seated, 
structural issues at the heart of economic challenges. 
(III) Both the methodologies of Maria Silva and João Rodrigues efficaciously revitalized the economy during 
the 1980s. 
The passage does not suggest that both methodologies efficaciously revitalized the economy during the 
1980s. Instead, it states that the once-successful policies from the 1980s are now proving inadequate in 
the current scenario. 
Therefore, the accurate statement is (I) Only. The inadequacy of historical policies emphasizes the need  
for innovative strategies in the modern economic landscape.

The intricate interplay between urban planning and public health becomes evident in the prevalence of 
"food deserts," underscoring the importance of designing communities that facilitate access to nutritious 
options for all residents. 
 
S152. Ans.(c) 
Sol. Sentences (A) and (C) have grammatical errors. 
(A) "Despite of facing challenges, she persevered and achieved success in her chosen field." 
The correct phrase is "Despite facing challenges" instead of "Despite of facing challenges." The preposition 
"of" is unnecessary after "Despite." 
(C) "Learning a new language can be both challenging or rewarding, requiring consistent practice 
and dedication." 
The correct conjunction to use when presenting two contrasting ideas is "and" instead of "or." Therefore, 
it should be "both challenging and rewarding" instead of "both challenging or rewarding." 
The corrected sentences are: 
(A) "Despite facing challenges, she persevered and achieved success in her chosen field." 
(C) "Learning a new language can be both challenging and rewarding, requiring consistent practice and 
dedication." 
 
S153. Ans.(b) 
Sol. Only sentence (D) has grammatical error. 
In sentence (D), The subject "collection" is singular, so it should be "was" instead of "were." The corrected 
sentence is, "The collection of rare stamps, along with a few vintage coins, was displayed in a glass case." 
 
S154. Ans.(c) 
Sol. The correct sequence is BACED.

being of nations.
