Direction: In the question below is given 
a 
statement 
followed 
by 
three 
assumptions numbered I, II and III. An 
assumption is something supposed or 
taken for granted. You have to consider 
the following assumption and decide 
which of the assumption is implicit in the 
statement.  
 
16. Statement: Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi on February 24 will launch the Rs 
75,000-crore 
Pradhan 
Mantri 
Kisan 
Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme in 
Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, by transferring 
the first of the three installments of Rs 
2,000 each to over one crore farmers 
having cultivable land up to two hectares. 
Another one crore farmers will be covered 
in the next 2-3 days. 
Assumptions: 
I. 
The 
central 
government 
had 
announced the PM-KISAN scheme under 
which Rs 6,000 per year will be given in 
three installments to small and marginal 
farmers holding cultivable land up to two 
hectares. 
II. The scheme has been made effective 
from this fiscal itself and as a result, 
farmers would get one installment before 
March-end. This programme is part of the 
government's effort to address farm 
sector distress. 
III. To provide an assured income 
support to the small and marginal 
farmers, the government is launching the 
Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-
KISAN). 
A. Only II is implicit 
B. All I, II and III are implicit 
C. None is implicit 
D. Only I is implicit 
E. Only III is implicit 
 
Direction: In each question below is 
given a statement followed by three 
assumptions numbered I, II and III. An 
assumption is something supposed or 
taken for granted. You have to consider 
the following assumption and decide 
which of the assumption is implicit in the 
statement.  
17. Statement: The Indian authorities 
have allowed commercial operations to all 
the airports that were shut after a few 
fighter jets of the Pakistani Air Force 
entered the Indian side of Kashmir. The 
authorities had informed all airlines that 
airports near the Jammu & Kashmir 
region and Dehradun have been closed. 
Assumptions: 
I. The Pakistani Air Force entered into the 
Indian side of Kashmir after the Indian Air 
Force entered the Pakistani territory and 
bombed a terrorist training centre in 
Pakistan. 
II. Several airline executives confirmed 
that the government has informed them 
that flights to Jammu, Srinagar, Leh, 
Amritsar, Dehradun & Dharamshala have 
been suspended ‘till further notice.’ 
III. One official added that no Notice to 
Airmen (NOTAM) has been issued yet. It

the airlines have received, the source in 
the know said. 
A. None is implicit 
B. Only I is implicit 
C. Both II and III are implicit 
D. Only III is implicit 
E. Only II is implicit 
 
Direction: In the question below, are 
given a statement followed by three 
courses of actions numbered I, II and III. 
On the basis of the information given, you 
have to assume everything in the 
statement to be true, and then decide 
which of the suggested courses of action 
logically follow(s) for pursuing.  
 
18. Statement: Early-stage startups and 
small businesses in India have been 
shying away from hiring women after the 
government increased paid maternity 
leave in 2017, a survey shows. An 
amendment to the Maternity Benefits Act, 
passed in March 2017, raised paid 
maternity leave for women from 12 
weeks to 26 weeks, benefitting 1.8 
million women workers in the organised 
sector. 
The 
law 
applies 
to 
all 
establishments employing 10 or more 
people, and the entitlement applies only 
up to the first two children. LocalCircles, 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
a citizens’ forum which surveyed 9,000 
early-stage 
startups 
and 
small 
businesses, said hiring women who will 
avail 
of 
maternity 
benefits, 
which 
includes six months’ paid leave, has 
turned into a significant economic burden 
for 
startups 
that 
typically 
run 
on 
shoestring budgets. In the survey, 46% 
of the respondents said they hired mostly 
male employees in the last 18 months. 
Courses of action: 
I. While the government late last year 
said it will refund employers for seven 
weeks of pay given to an employee on 
maternity leave, startups and SMEs said 
it isn’t enough to cover the cost. As per 
the survey, 65% of the respondents said 
that even 19 weeks of pay would be too 
much for them to absorb. 
II. According to the latest Monster Salary 
Index report, women still earn 19% less 
than their male counterparts in India. 
This gap has decreased by 1% from last 
year. Further, the report adds that 
women-led businesses received only 65% 
of the funding secured by male-led ones. 
III. However, not all small startups agree 
that maternity benefits need to be 
scrapped. Rohan Shravan, founder of AI 
startup Inkers Technology said that 
among his team of nine employees, three 
are women, and unlike many firms of its 
size, they even offer extended paternity 
leave benefit to employees. 
A. All follow 
B. Neither I nor III follows 
C. Only I follows 
D. None follows 
E. Only III follows

Direction (28 – 29) : Read the given 
passage below and answer the questions. 
Amid a changing environment, with 
natural homes of birds getting depleted 
as 
natural 
forests 
make 
way 
for 
plantations and other such modified 
 
 
 
 
7 
 
terrains, comes the good news of how the 
great Indian hornbill adapts to such 
change. A group of researchers from 
NCBS-TIFR in Bengaluru and Nature 
Conservation 
Foundation 
in 
Mysuru 
observed eight hornbill nests, three 
located in contiguous forests and five 
located in modified habitats such as 
coffee plantations. They found that the 
birds followed similar nesting behaviour 
but 
adapted 
to 
the 
changing 
environment. The team chose to study 
the great Indian hornbills nesting in the 
Anamalai hills. For comparison, the 
researchers located the study in the 
modified habitat in the Valparai plateau 
and 
the 
contiguous 
forests 
in 
the 
Anamalai 
Tiger 
Reserve 
and 
the 
Vazhachal Reserve forests. The modified 
habitat 
included 
tea, 
coffee 
and 
cardamom 
plantations, 
and 
tribal 
settlements.  
 
28. Which of the following is not an apt 
conclusion on the basis of the information 
provided? 
A. Some of the nests were discovered 
during the study with the help of local 
tribal assistants. 
B. Great hornbills may adapt to habitat 
modification provided that their key 
requirements for food and nesting are 
fulfilled in the habitats like coffee and 
forest fragments. 
C. Considering that hornbills use same 
nest over years, protection of these 
known nest trees and retention of large 
trees that can be potential nests is 
absolutely essential. 
D. None of the above. 
E. All of the above. 
 
29. Which of the following is/are a 
suitable course of action in lieu of the 
information provided? 
A. Hornbills are secondary cavity nesters 
and choose cavities formed in large trees 
for nesting. Also, they are monogamous, 
and the female, after copulation, seals 
herself in the hole until the initial 
breeding period of two-four months is 
over. 
B. The team also highlighted the potential 
of 
rainforest 
fragments 
and 
coffee 
plantation for conservation of hornbills 
outside of protected areas. 
C. In addition, it is necessary to have a 
diversity 
of 
native 
tree 
species, 
particularly figs, laurels and other food 
plants. 
D. Along with other threats such as 
hunting, modified land use, ensuing 
forest fragmentation, felling of large trees 
with the potential for nesting, the loss of 
fruit bearing trees could also affect 
hornbill nesting habits. 
E. Considering that hornbills use same 
nest over years, protection of these 
known nest trees and retention of large 
trees that can be potential nests is 
absolutely essential. 
 
30. Direction: Study the information 
given below and answer the questions 
based on it. 
Revenue growth at mid-tier IT services 
firms such as Hexaware, Zensar, Mphasis 
and L&T Infotech is set to pick up, 
boosted by strong deal wins as they see 
customers keen to invest more in 
technology projects. While they are 
projected to outpace large rivals such as 
Infosys and Wipro in growth, the pressure 
on their margins is likely to be higher. 
Which of the following can be logically 
inferred from the above information? 
A. All indicators show that these mid-tier 
IT service firms will again grow better 
than industry average in FY2020. Their 
pipeline is better than last year. They are 
growing both existing accounts and 
getting new logos and deals especially in 
the last quarter. 
B. It is broad-based growth, across 
geographies, verticals and service lines, 
unlike their large peers where we see 
softness in a few geographies and 
verticals. 
C. Mid-tier companies are sharpening 
their overall strategy, by increasing focus 
on certain markets and businesses than 
spread thin. 
D. While these firms are growing fast, 
their margins continue to be under 
pressure. The pricing pressure in the 
 
 
 
 
8 
 
traditional segment can erode their 
margins further. 
E. All can be inferred.

Direction: The question given below 
consists of a statement, followed by three 
arguments numbered I, II and III. You 
have to decide which of the arguments 
is/are ‘strong’ arguments and which 
is/are ‘weak’ arguments and accordingly 
choose your answer from the alternatives 
given below each question.  
40. Statement: India has conveyed to 
Russia that it will not be part of the 
project now to develop a fifth-generation 
fighter aircraft (FGFA) and may join the 
programme at a later stage, according to 
Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. It 
was conveyed to Russia that they can go 
ahead with the project and we may join it 
at a later stage. 
Which among the following arguments 
support the above statement in the best 
possible manner? 
Arguments: 
I. India and Russia had signed an inter-
governmental agreement for the mega 
project in 2007, vowing to take the 
 
 
 
 
10 
 
military ties between the two strategic 
partners to the next level. 
II. However, the project has been stuck 
for the last 11 years as there have been 
serious differences between the two sides 
on sharing the cost of developing the jet, 
technologies to be used in it and number 
of aircraft to be produced. 
III. The government is adopting a layered 
approach to achieve the final goal of 
theatre command and that the thrust was 
on a bottom-up approach. 
A. None is strong. 
B. Only III and II are strong. 
C. Only III is strong. 
D. All except III and I are strong. 
E. All are strong. 
 
41. After GST and demonetisation, rising 
interest rates are set to hurt SMEs. 
Interest rates for loans against property 
(LAP) extended to small and medium 
sized enterprises (SMEs) are set to rise in 
the coming months of 2018 ‘ Rising 
interest rates, in addition to the muted 
operating 
environment 
for 
small 
businesses in India, will lead to an 
increase 
in 
delinquencies 
on 
LAP 
extended to SMEs’. The introduction of 
the goods and services tax (GST) in July 
2017 
and 
the 
government's 
demonetization policy have placed stress 
on the SME sector, which rising interest 
rates will exacerbate. 
Which of the following can be logically 
inferred from the statement above? 
A. In addition to rising delinquencies over 
the last few years would force lenders to 
be more cautious while underwriting 
loans. 
This 
would 
limit 
refinancing 
options, 
adversely 
affecting 
existing 
borrowers. 
B. But losses will be limited because these 
loans are secured and have relatively low 
loan-to-value ratios. 
C. 
Rising 
interest 
rates 
will 
limit 
refinancing 
options 
and 
increase 
repayment amounts, increasing risks for 
asset backed securities (ABS) backed by 
LAP to SMEs. 
D. The ABS (asset backed securities) 
backed by LAP extended to SMEs have 
non-amortizing 
cash 
reserves, 
substantial 
excess 
spread 
and 
the 
possibility to extend the life of the loans 
and hence the life of the transactions. 
E. None can be inferred. 
 
Direction: Two statements are followed 
by three conclusions I, II and III. You 
have to consider the statements to be 
true, even if they seem to be at variance 
from commonly known facts. You have to 
decide which of the given conclusions can 
definitely be drawn from the given 
statements and indicate your answer 
accordingly.  
 
42. Statements: 
I. The world’s largest bee — a giant insect 
roughly the size of a human thumb — has 
been rediscovered in a remote part of 
Indonesia in its first sighting in nearly 40 
years, researchers said. 
II. Despite its conspicuous size, no one 
had observed Wallace’s giant bee — 
discovered in the 19th century by British 
naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace. 
Conclusions: 
I. Several previous expeditions to the 
region where the bee lives failed to spot 
it. 
II. Indonesia is home to an abundant 
variety of flora and fauna but there are 
fears 
for 
some 
animal 
and 
insect 
communities as forests being cut down 
for agriculture threaten many species’ 
natural habitat. 
III. The bee which lives in the Indonesian 
island region of North Moluccas, makes 
its nest in termite mounds, using its large 
fang-like mandibles to collect sticky resin 
to protect its home from the termites. 
A. Only conclusion I follows 
B. Both conclusions II and III follow 
C. Only conclusion III follows 
D. Only conclusion II follows 
E. Both conclusions I and II follow

Direction (121 – 123) : Read the given 
passage 
carefully 
and 
answer 
the 
questions that follow. Certain words are 
printed in bold to help you locate them 
while answering some of these. 
Meritocracy has become a leading social 
ideal. Politicians across the ideological 
spectrum continually return to the theme 
that the rewards of life – money, power, 
jobs, university admission – should be 
distributed according to skill and effort. 
The most common metaphor is the “even 
 
 
 
 
21 
 
playing field” upon which players can rise 
to the position that fits their merit. 
Conceptually and morally, meritocracy is 
presented as the opposite of systems 
such as hereditary aristocracy, in which 
one’s social position is determined by the 
lottery of birth. Under meritocracy, 
wealth and advantage are merit’s rightful 
compensation, not the fortuitous windfall 
of external events. 
Most people don’t just think the world 
should be run meritocratically, they think 
it is meritocratic. In the United Kingdom, 
84% of respondents to the 2009 British 
Social Attitudes survey stated that hard 
work is either “essential” or “very 
important” when it comes to getting 
ahead, and in 2016 the Brookings 
Institute found that 69% of Americans 
believe that people are rewarded for 
intelligence and skill. Respondents in both 
countries believe that external factors, 
such as luck and coming from a wealthy 
family, are much less important. While 
these ideas are most pronounced in these 
two countries, they are popular across 
the globe. 
Although widely held, the belief that merit 
rather than luck determines success or 
failure in the world is demonstrably false. 
This is not least because merit itself is, in 
large part, the result of luck. Talent and 
the 
capacity 
for 
determined 
effort, 
sometimes called “grit”, depend a great 
deal on one’s genetic endowments and 
upbringing. 
This is to say nothing of the fortuitous 
circumstances that figure into every 
success story. In his 2016 book Success 
and Luck, the US economist Robert Frank 
recounts the long-shots and coincidences 
that led to Bill Gates’s stellar rise as 
Microsoft’s founder, as well as to Frank’s 
own success as an academic. Luck 
intervenes by granting people merit, and 
again by furnishing circumstances in 
which merit can translate into success.

Direction (128 – 130) : Read the given 
passage 
carefully 
and 
answer 
the 
questions that follow. Certain words are 
printed in bold to help you locate them 
while answering some of these. 
When it comes to English books, it is 
authors like Kavita Kané, Utkarsh Patel, 
and, more recently, Saiswaroopa Iyer, 
who seem to have passionately taken up 
the 
cause 
of 
feminist 
revisionist 
mythology. 
Kané has written a string of books over 
the years that are determinedly feminist 
in nature. She picks the most unusual 
characters 
(sometimes 
even 
creates 
them!) to tell her readers what-may-
have-been. Her first was titled Karna’s 
Wife: The Outcast’s Queen (2014), which 
told the story of Karna through his 
(fictional) wife, Uruvi. 
It is interesting that Kané chose to 
introduce an entirely new character to tell 
Karna’s story in the space of mythological 
fiction. The Mahabharata speaks of no 
one called Uruvi. Karna is married to 
Vrushali, 
Duryodhana’s 
charioteer’s 
sister, and to another woman named 
Supriya. 
Both 
are 
blink-and-miss 
characters, with little to say or do in the 
epic. But in Kané’s re-imagined world, 
Karna’s second wife is Uruvi. She is a 
woman passionately in love with her 
husband and plays an active role in his 
unfolding narrative. 
Here, we deal with not one but two 
subaltern voices – of the woman and of 
the low caste. Kane’s inspiration for this 
name seems to have come from some 
references in later Tamil literature, where 
Karna’s 
wife 
is 
named 
Ponnaruvi. 
However, it is conjectured that Ponnaruvi 
was an epithet for either Vrushali or 
Supriya or both. 
 
 
 
 
23 
 
Kané’s next was Sita’s Sister (2014), 
where she constructed the life and 
character of the little-known wife of 
Lakshmana, Urmila. The Ramayana takes 
scant notice of her, and when it does, 
consigns her to what is essentially a 14-
year long coma. But Kané imagined her 
as a living, breathing heroine who holds 
the fort when everything is crumbling and 
everyone important has left.

Direction (137 – 139) : Read the given 
passage 
carefully 
and 
answer 
the 
questions that follow. Certain words are 
printed in bold to help you locate them 
while answering some of these. 
The 150-kilometre road trip from Narnaul 
to Delhi took all of three hours. For young 
Ashok Khemka, it was well worth the 
effort. The newly minted IAS officer, 
posted in Narnaul, had a date with a 
charming young woman in Delhi and was 
keen to see her. The young lady in 
question was his fiancée and Ashok, on 
his maiden posting as an IAS officer of the 
Haryana cadre, was naturally eager to 
meet her as often as possible. 
As a member of the 1991 batch of 
LBSNAA in Mussoorie, he had found 
himself in the crosshairs of groom 
hunters. 
Ambitious 
parents 
of 
marriageable daughters descended 
(and 
possibly 
still 
do) 
on 
the 
academy on an annual basis to stalk 
young trainees in the hope of finding 
an “IAS match”. Khemka had managed 
to evade them all. It was in Delhi that he 
had met Jyoti, the woman destined to 
illuminate his home. 
She had graduated from the University of 
Delhi and was contemplating a course in 
journalism. But Jyoti’s father had taken a 
shine to Khemka and was keen on the 
match. Jyoti had a deep respect for her 
father’s opinion, so she had decided to go 
with the flow. Jyoti and Ashok were 
engaged in a quiet ceremony at her home 
on the auspicious occasion of Dussehra in 
1993. Every alternate weekend, he would 
head to Shakti Nagar in Delhi to meet her, 
before hightailing it back to Narnaul. He 
had no idea that someone was keeping 
tabs on his movements. 
As a sub-divisional officer (SDO), Khemka 
reported to the deputy commissioner of 
the district. He had not exactly hit it off 
with his boss, who fancied himself a man 
of culture and a connoisseur of music and 
dance.

Direction (145 – 147) : Read the given 
passage 
carefully 
and 
answer 
the 
questions that follow. Certain words are 
printed in bold to help you locate them 
while answering some of these. 
Defence expenditure is an important 
component of national security and every 
country allocates a significant portion of 
its resources for this purpose. However, 
given the scarcity of resources and the 
competing demands from other sectors, a 
nation’s ability to meet all its Defence 
requirements is not unlimited. Even the 
United 
States, 
the 
only 
military 
superpower, is unable to afford many of 
its major programmes, forcing it to scale 
down the number of items to be procured. 
The sheer size of the Defence budget and 
its impact on other sectors of the 
economy thus, more often raises the 
question as to how much a country can 
afford for its Defence. 
In the absence of any clear framework of 
evaluating 
affordability 
of 
Defence 
spending, many analysts tend to view the 
same from the perspective of a country’s 
share of Defence in gross domestic 
product (GDP) over a period of time, or 
by comparing these shares with those of 
other countries. This method of relative 
measurement, however, suffers from 
ambiguities as it does not take into 
account a country’s specific security 
concerns and the economic compulsions 
in its totality. In the global context, the 
affordability of military spending of some 
of the world’s major military spenders 
varies not only in degree but also from 
time to time. While the variation in the 
degree of affordability indicates the 
changing 
security 
threats 
that 
are 
perceived differently by countries, the 
fluctuation in affordability over time 
points to the fact that what may be 
affordable at one point in time, may not 
be so at another time. Among the major 
powers, except for Japan, no other 
country 
has 
been 
able 
to 
sustain 
consistently 
high 
level 
of 
Defence 
spending (in percentage of GDP) over a 
length of time. The macro economy, 
which guides major spending heads of the 
government, 
could 
be 
a 
factor 
in 
controlling Defence spending over a 
period of time. In the US, the present 
level of military spending has contributed 
to fiscal distress, raising doubts whether 
such large-scale military spending is 
affordable or sustainable in the future.

145. What does the author mean by “...a 
nation’s ability to meet all its Defence 
requirements is not unlimited.”?

allotment made for the defence sector 
and all other sectors receive their funding 
beyond that. 
B. The defence expenditure has remained 
within 
the 
government’s 
desired 
objectives

C. National expenditure cannot focus only 
on defence sector as there are other 
sectors that also require funding and 
resources are limited.

requirements as resources are often 
 
 
 
 
27 
 
limited 
which 
has 
to 
be 
equally 
distributed among all sectors in a nation. 
E. A nation can only meets its defence 
requirements once all other sectors have 
been properly funded which makes its 
options limited in the defence sector.

Good Food is First Food. It is not junk 
food. It is the food that connects nature 
and nutrition with livelihoods. This food is 
good for our health; it comes from the 
rich _________(A)____________ of our 
regions; it provides employment to 
people. Most importantly, cooking and 
eating it gives us pleasure. 
In 2013, we had published the first 
edition of First Food series. I had written 
then that food is about culture and 
biodiversity. We often do not think that 
food diversity, indeed cultural diversity, is 
linked to the diversity in the biological 
world. We argued then that we must 
celebrate the knowledge of plants and 
their properties and how best to cook 
them to bring out the flavours and smells. 
We said then — and we are saying again 
now — that only when we value the 
biodiversity on our plates, will we be able 
to protect the biodiversity in the wild. 
In 2017 came the second edition First 
Food: Culture of Taste. In this book, as in 
the first, we offered recipes of foods along 
with the knowledge of plant diversity. We 
did this because it was becoming clear the 
world was (and is) facing an obesity 
pandemic — much of the food we eat 
today is bad for health, with no nutrition 
or goodness. More importantly, it is now 
clear that this change in our diet — 
moving 
away 
from 
home-cooked, 
nutritious foods borne out of culinary 
traditions and age-old knowledge — is not 
incidental or accidental. We are children 
of the age of processed and factory-
grown foods, who have been trans-
mutated 
through 
a 
deliberate 
and 
 
 
 
 
28 
 
subliminal marketing that has changed 
our habits and our culture of food. 
We need a re-discovery of this knowledge 
of food and culture. All is not lost yet — 
we still eat home-cooked, bio-diverse and 
nutritious food. But this scenario is 
changing 
rapidly. 
Already, 
there 
is 
evidence that the incidence of diabetes — 
a disease with strong links to bad food — 
is increasing, not just among the affluent 
but also the poor of urban India.

Financial exclusion is the main cause of 
poverty. Lack of opportunities and access 
to finance besides financial illiteracy are 
the main causes of financial exclusion. 
Financial inclusion is proving to be a 
major thorn in the path of Indian 
economic growth. Access to finance by 
the poor, disadvantaged and unprivileged 
group is a prerequisite for poverty 
reduction and social upliftment. One of 
the main reasons why the large section of 
the rural population still remains under 
below poverty line is lack of opportunities 
and access to finance besides financial 
 
 
 
 
29 
 
illiteracy. Large sections of the rural 
population have no access to financial 
services and their only recourse is to 
borrow from money lenders, who charge 
exorbitant rates. Also, ignorance is rife, 
with concepts like insurance virtually 
unheard of. One of the main reasons why 
mass poverty is persisting in India is that 
the problem of financing the poor still 
remains unresolved (RBI, 2011a), with 
almost all states show more than 60% of 
populations below the poverty line. 
Projections based on NSSO data present 
a disturbing picture as population cut offs 
for average consumption for almost all 
states fall between the sixth and seventh 
deciles, statistics for which are available 
in its report “Key indicators of household 
expenditure in India.” Further fine-tuned, 
they deliver a precise percentage of 
population below the average spends 
(Sunday Times, 2012). The large section 
of population below the expenditure 
curve also points to a worrying inequity in 
incomes, something that should concern 
planners as the government looks to 
target benefits for those who need them 
through initiatives like food security and 
employment guarantees (Sunday Times, 
2012).

16. Ans. B.  
 
The correct answer is option B, i.e. All I, 
II and III are implicit. 
An assumption is a thing that is accepted 
as true or as certain to happen, without 
proof. 
From the statement, it is evident that it is 
about the PM-KISAN scheme which is 
entitled to small and medium farmers 
having cultivable land up to two hectares. 
The first installment as promised by the 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be 
processed on February 24. 
Assumption (I) is a perfect assumption 
based on the information provided. The 
figure of 6000 is evident from the 
information stated, ‘first of the three 
installments of Rs 2,000 each’. 
Assumption (II) is also appropriate. The 
idea of the scheme launched in this fiscal 
is evident from the fact that PM is 
launching it now and before March end 
the first transaction would be done. It 
also highlights the general idea behind 
the scheme to help the distressed 
farmers. 
Similarly, 
assumption 
(III) 
is 
also 
appropriate as it follows the flow of the 
ideas stated and brings out the financial 
benefit the scheme will provide to the 
farmers. 
Thus, all of the assumptions are relevant 
thus the most appropriate answer choice 
is option B. 
17. Ans. A.  
 
The correct answer is option A, i.e. 
None is implicit. 
An assumption is a thing that is accepted 
as true or as certain to happen, without 
proof. 
From the statement, it is evident the 
Indian 
authorities 
have 
allowed 
commercial operations to all the airports 
near the Jammu & Kashmir region and 
Dehradun that were shut after a few 
fighter jets of the Pakistani Air Force 
entered the Indian side of Kashmir. And 
further 
information 
regarding 
its 
components is also mentioned. 
Assumption (I) can be rejected as the 
information stated in it is not backed by 
the context given. 
Assumption (II) is not an apt assumption 
that can be made on the basis of the 
information provided. All the places 
mentioned 
for 
example 
Amritsar, 
Dharamshala are not evident from the 
given context. 
Assumption (III) is rejected as it is 
contradictory to the information stated. It 
states that no NOTAM has been issued 
whereas the given information states that 
information 
has 
been 
sent 
to 
the 
authorities. 
Thus, 
all 
of 
the 
assumptions 
are 
irrelevant and can be rejected and the 
most appropriate answer choice is option 
A 
 
 
 
 
34 
 
18. Ans. D.  
The correct answer is option D, i.e. 
None follows. 
A course of action is something that 
needs to be done considering the present 
scenario in mind. 
From the statement, it is evident that it’s 
about Maternity leave granted to the 
women employees as per the law and 
how the companies have been avoiding 
hiring female staff in order to avoid 
maternity leaves to them. Thus, a 
suitable course of action must be in the 
sense to avoid this injustice being done to 
women. 
Course of action (I) can be rejected as it 
presents a course of action that is already 
stated by the government (past tensE.. 
Moreover, it further presents the problem 
and does not present the solution to it 
and is thus rejected. 
Course of action (II) is rejected as it 
simply presents facts and does not 
suggest any course of action. 
Based on similar grounds, course of 
action (III) is also rejected. Course of 
action (III) also shows the views of the 
startups and the stats but it fails to 
provide a solution to the problem. 
Thus, all the courses of actions are 
irrelevant and can be rejected.

While the only left student is C who is the

Final Arrangement -  
 
28. Ans. E.  
The correct answer is option E, i.e. All 
of the above, i.e. all of the above are 
not an appropriate set of conclusions 
that 
can 
be 
derived 
from 
the 
information provided. 
The given question asks which of the 
following is not an apt conclusion on the 
basis of the information provided thus we 
must look for any such information that 
cannot be derived from the passage 
stated. 
Option A is not based on the passage as 
the role of ‘local tribal assistants’ is not 
mentioned in the given context. 
Option 
B 
talks 
about 
a 
possibility 
(because of the word ‘may’) and is thus 
not a conclusion. Moreover, it poses a 
particular case of hornbills adapting to 
the environment if their requirements are 
fulfilled, which is not explicitly evident 
from the information provided. 
Option C discusses the idea of hornbills 
using same nest over the years which is 
contradicting to the idea of adapting to a 
changed environment. 
As all options A, B and C are irrelevant 
and are not based on the information 
provided thus, the most correct answer 
choice is option E. 
29. Ans. D.  
The correct answer is option D, i.e. 
Along with other threats such as 
hunting, modified land use, ensuing 
forest fragmentation, felling of large 
trees with the potential for nesting, 
the loss of fruit bearing trees could 
also affect hornbill nesting habits. 
A course of action is something that 
needs to be done considering the present 
scenario in mind. 
Option A is not a course of action and is a 
general statement about Hornbills. Thus, 
it is rejected. 
Option B is in past tense (‘highlighted’) 
thus it is rejected. 
Option C is an incomplete action, if 
considered because it does not answer to 
the question ‘In addition to what?’ and is 
also eliminated. 
Both options D and E look appropriate 
course of actions. Between options D and 
E, option D is more appropriate. Option E 
talks about the idea of the ‘same nest’ 
and thus contradicts the idea that 
hornbills are adaptive to change. Thus, 
option E can also be rejected and as a 
result between options D and E, option D 
is relevant. 
Thus, the most correct answer choice is 
option D and rest of the options can be 
rejected. 
30. Ans. C.  
The correct answer is option 3, i.e. Mid-
tier companies are sharpening their 
overall strategy, by increasing focus 
on certain markets and businesses 
than spread thin. 
‘Inference’ is a conclusion reached on the 
basis of evidence and reasoning. 
We first make sure to read the statement 
carefully and then see what immediate 
inferences can be drawn based on our 
first reading. The next step is to look at 
the statements given in the options, 
analyze them and see if they seem 
relevant 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
information/data provided to us. 
From the statement, we can infer that 
mid-tier IT companies are growing in 
terms of revenue with the advent of 
technology projects. Though, they are 
expected to outcast giants like Infosys 
and Wipro, the pressure on their margins 
is likely to increase. 
(1) can be rejected as the ‘indicators’ 
mentioned in the beginning of the 
sentence are not mentioned anywhere in 
the given context. Also no information is 
evident regarding new logos. 
(2) can also be rejected as no information 
is evident on the basis of the given 
context 
regarding 
expansion 
across 
geographies, verticals and service lines.

(4) can be eliminated as it just a rephrase 
of the information already provided in the 
given statement. 
From the given assumptions (3) is the 
most appropriate deduction that can be 
made. 
(3) can be logically inferred on the basis 
of the fact that these companies are 
improving their strategy (which has 
impacted 
their 
revenue 
growth) 
by 
targeting certain markets and businesses 
(new technology projects). 
As all the other options except (3) are 
irrelevant with respect to the data 
provided in the statement. Thus, the 
correct answer is option 3. 
31. Ans. B.  
The one who is heaviest among all sits 
third to the right of N, who is 60 years of 
age. The one who is 30yrs is the heaviest 
among all. Only one person sits between 
N and the one who is second heaviest 
among all, who is 14 years of age. Q is 
shorter than only two person. So, there 
will 
two 
possible 
case 
of 
sitting 
arrangement. 
 
The one who is 35 years of age is second 
tallest, who sits second to the right of Q, 
who is not the immediate neighbour of N. 
O who is half the age of M. So M is 28 
years of age and O is 14 years of age. 
 
The one who sits opposite to R is the 
second heaviest among all. R sits second 
to the right P. So, case 1 will be 
eliminated. Continuing with remaining 
step, the one who is older than P is the 
taller than Q. The one who is twice the 
age of Q is third lightest among all. So, Q 
is 30 years of age. 
 
M sits third to the right of the one who 
shortest in height among all. That means 
R is shortest of them all. M is taller than 
the one who is 14 years old.

R is shortest of them all. M is taller than 
the 
one 
who 
is 
14 
years 
old.
 
34. Ans. B.  
The one who is heaviest among all sits 
third to the right of N, who is 60 years of 
age. The one who is 30yrs is the heaviest 
among all. Only one person sits between 
N and the one who is second heaviest

From statement I: 
O got more salary than only two persons. 
N > M but N did not get the highest 
salary. Q got highest salary than only R. 
P > N > M > O > Q > R 
From statement II: 
M got less salary than only two persons. 
Q > R, O > Q. M > O. P > N 
P > N > M > O > Q > R 
Hence, the data in statement I or in 
statement II alone is sufficient to answer 
the question. 
36. Ans. C.  
From this information their positions are 
in decreasing order- 
A(400)>B>C>D>E>F(60) 
It is given D, E and F have average marks 
= 95 
So total marks=95 x 3= 285 
F got 60 marks so- 
D+E=285-60= 225 marks

40. Ans. C.  
The correct answer is option 3, i.e. Only 
III is strong. 
We first make sure to read the statement 
carefully and then see what immediate 
inferences can be drawn based on our 
first reading. The next step is to look at 
the arguments given in the options, 
analyze them and see if they seem 
 
 
 
 
46 
 
relevant 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
information/data provided to us. Finally, 
it is very important to study the question 
closely. 
The above statement deals with the fact 
that India has opted out from the deal 
with Russia and the latter has been 
conveyed that it can go ahead with the 
project and India may join it at a later 
stage. 
Argument (I) can be rejected on first 
reading as it deals with the details of the 
deal and does not answers the question 
asked. 
Argument (II) can also be rejected as it 
hints at the idea of the problems between 
the two nations. It might look as an 
appropriate answer choice but does not 
provides a suitable reason as to why India 
may be interested in the project in later 
stages (as mentioned in the statement). 
Argument (III) generalizes the approach 
of India that it is adopting a layered 
approach and might be interested in the 
project later on. It captures the essence 
of the given statement and thus, answers 
the question in the complete manner. 
Thus, option 3 captures the correct 
arguments that support the statement in 
the best possible manner and is our 
answer choice. Hence, rest of the options 
can be rejected. 
41. Ans. A.  
The correct answer is option 1, i.e. In 
addition to rising delinquencies over 
the last few years would force 
lenders to be more cautious while 
underwriting loans. This would limit 
refinancing 
options, 
adversely 
affecting existing borrowers. 
Option 
1 
is 
the 
most 
appropriate 
inference that can be made based on the 
information provided. It captures all the 
important 
points 
like 
‘rising 
delinquencies’, ‘effect of limit on the 
refinancing options thereby, affecting the 
customers’ are evident both from the 
given statement and the option choice. 
Rest of the arguments can be rejected. 
Option (2) is very unpredictable and it 
cannot be said with surety about the loss 
limitation. Both options (3) and (4) can 
also be rejected as no idea of ABS (asset 
backed securities) is evident from the 
information 
provided 
in 
the 
given 
statement. 
Thus, the most appropriate answer is 
option 1. 
42. Ans. A.  
The correct answer is option A, i.e. 
Only conclusion I follows. 
In this type of question, conclusion is 
not specifically mentioned. It needs 
to 
be 
deduced 
from 
the 
given 
statements. 
From both the statements, we infer 
that the world’s largest bee which is 
roughly the size of a human thumb has 
been rediscovered in a remote part of 
Indonesia. And despite of its conspicuous 
size, no one had observed Wallace’s giant 
bee which was discovered in the 19th 
century by British naturalist Alfred Russel 
Wallace. 
Conclusion 1 is evident from the 
information stated in the second 
statement which states that ‘despite 
of its (bee’s) conspicuous size, no one 
had observed Wallace’s giant bee’. Thus, 
it 
can 
be 
concluded 
that 
previous 
expeditions failed to spot it. 
Conclusion 2 is irrelevant as the idea of 
forests being cut down for agriculture in 
Indonesia is not supported by the 
information stated in the given context. 
Conclusion 3 is also rejected as the 
specific location where the bee can be 
traced, and its large fang-like mandibles 
is not mentioned in both the statements. 
As only conclusion I follows the direction 
of the given statements thus, the most 
correct answer choice is option A and rest 
of the options can be rejected. 
43. Ans. E.  
1) Two persons sit between R and P. 
Here, we have two possible cases i.e. 
Case 1 and Case 2. 
2) P faces inside. 
 
3) S sits second to the right of R. 
Here, we have two more possible cases 
i.e. Case 3 and Case 4.

7) M and N faces same direction as P and 
not more than two persons sit adjacent to 
each other who are facing same direction. 
Here, Case 4 gets eliminated. 
So, S faces outside and our final 
arrangement will be: 
 
Clearly, L does not belong to that group 
because except L all are facing inside the 
table.

Clearly, P sits second to the right of the 
one who sits third to the left of N. 
45. Ans. A.  
1) Two persons sit between R and P. 
Here, we have two possible cases i.e. 
Case 1 and Case 2. 
2) P faces inside. 
 
3) S sits second to the right of R. 
Here, we have two more possible cases 
i.e. Case 3 and Case 4. 
 
 
 
 
48 
 
 
4) Only one person sits between N and S 
who does not sit at corner of the table. 
Here, our case 1 and 3 get eliminated and 
we further proceed with case 2 and 4. 
5) L faces opposite direction to R. 
6) M sits 2nd to the left of L. 
 
7) M and N faces same direction as P and 
not more than two persons sit adjacent to 
each other who are facing same direction. 
Here, Case 4 gets eliminated. 
So, S faces outside and our final 
arrangement will be: 
 
Clearly, three persons sit between S and 
N when counted from the right of N.

Pattern of the series I: 
1 + 600 = 601 
 
So, a = 761 
Pattern of the series II: 
753 + 16 = 769 
769 – 8 = 761 
761 + 4 = 765 
765 – 2 = 763 
763 + 1 = 764 
So, b = 761 
Pattern of the series III: 
23 × 1 + 1 = 24 
24 × 2 + 2 = 50 
50 × 3 + 3 = 153 
153 × 4 + 4 = 616 
616 × 5 + 5 = 3085 
So, c = 616 
Hence, a = b > c 
47. Ans. A.  
Pattern of the series I (double 
difference): 
107 – 5 = 102 
117 – (5 + 5) = 107 
134 – (5 + 5 + 7) = 117 
134 – (5 + 5 + 7 + 9) = 160 
So, a = 160 
Pattern of the series II: 
130 – 15 = 115 
115 + 20 = 135 
135 – 25 = 110 
110 + 30 = 140 
So, b = 140 
Pattern of the series II: 
160 × 0.5 = 80 
80 × 1.5 = 120 
120 × 2.5 = 300 
300 × 3.5 = 1050 
So, c = 160 
Hence, b < a = c. 
48. Ans. C.  
 
Let the female population in village A and 
C be F 
Population of male in village A = (6000 – 
F) 
Population of male in village C = (4000 – 
F) 
According to the question: 
 × 100 + 125 = 
 × 100 
On solving above equation, we get F = 
1600 
Hence, male population in village A = 
6000 – 1600 = 4400 
49. Ans. E.  
 
 
 
 
49 
 
 
Population of village D = 9600 
Male population of village D = 9600 – 
4000 = 5600 
Gender ratio of village D = 
 × 100 = 
140 
50. Ans. A.  
Population density of village B in 2001 = 
400 
Then, population density of village E in 
2001 = 1600 (since, ratio of population 
density of a village B to that of village E 
is 1 : 4) 
Population density of village E in 2010 = 
800 (50% of 1600) 
Population of village E in 2010 = 800 × 4 
= 3200 
51. Ans. D.  
Total number of people shown interest for 
a loan = 9600 
Total number of people who have applied 
for loan = 37.5% of 9600 
= 
 × 9600 = 3600 
Since, 2880 were not eligible for a loan, 
So, total no. of people eligible for loan = 
3600 – 2880 = 720 
52. Ans. E.  
Total number of people shown interest for 
a loan = 9600 
Total number of people visited for a loan 
fair = 9600 + 6000 = 15,600 
Total number of people contacted for a 
loan fair = 15,600 + 7400 = 23,000. 
53. Ans. C.  
Total number of people contacted for loan 
fair = z 
Here, z is given as 19200 
Total number of people visited for the 
loan fair = x 
Total number of people who have shown 
interest for the loan fair = 9600 
Total number of people who did not visit 
for the loan fair = z – x or, 19200 – x 
Total number of people who visited but 
did shown interest loan = x – 9600 
Now, 
according to the question = 
 =  
⇒ x = 14,400 
54. Ans. E.  
Total number of people eligible for loan = 
20% of 37.5% of 9600 
or, 
 × 
 × 9600 = 720 
Loan of 40% of the people did not 
disbursed who were eligible for a loan = 
40% of 720 
or, 
= 288 
Total number of people whose loan 
disbursed = 720 – 288 = 432 
Hence, required ratio = 
= 
 
55. Ans. E.  
Total number of people eligible for loan = 
20% of 37.5% of 9600 
or, 
 × 
 × 9600 = 720 
Total number of people who shown 
interest but did not apply for loan = 
62.5% of 9600 
or, 
 × 9600 = 6000 
Now, 9% of 6000 = 540 = whose loans 
were not disbursed 
So, people whose loans were disbursed = 
720 – 540 = 180 
Hence, value of y = 180 
56. Ans. C.  
Total area of pie = (X × 0.77) cm2 
50% was rotten, therefore, the area of 
remaining 50% = (X – 3) × 0.616 cm2 
So, (X – 3) × 0.616 cm2 × 2 = (X × 0.77) 
cm2 
⇒ (1.232 – 0.77)X = 3.696 
⇒ X = 
 = 8 
57. Ans. E.  
Area of original pie = 8 × 0.77 cm2 
pr2 = 8 × 0.77 cm2 
⇒ r = 
 = 1.4 cm 
hence, the circumference of the original 
pie = 2pr = 2 × 3.14 × 1.4 = 8.792 cm 
58. Ans. B.  
 
 
 
 
50 
 
Area of original pie = 8 × 0.77 cm2 = 6.16 
cm2 
Pie is cut into 11 pieces 
So, area of each piece = 
 = 0.56 cm2 
59. Ans. C.  
Work unit of project A in both situation 1 
and situation 2 are same. 
X × 88 = (X + 8) × 66 
⇒ 8X – 6X = 48 
⇒ X = 24 
Now, According to question: 
24 × 88 = 64 × Required number of days 
Hence, required number of days = 
 = 33 days 
60. Ans. C.  
Work unit of project C in both situation 1 
and situation 2 are same. 
⇒ Z2 × 75 = M2 × 108 
⇒ 
 =

 = 
 
⇒ 
 =  
Total unit work of project C = 36 × 75 = 
2700 
Days required by Team P to complete 
Project C = 
 = 
= 90 days 
61. Ans. B.  
Work unit of project B in both situation 1 
and situation 2 are same. 
⇒ Y(Y – 1) = (Y + 6)(Y – 6) 
⇒ Y2 – Y = Y2 – 36 
⇒ Y = 36 
So, total work units = 36 × 35 = 1260 
According to the question: 
0.5Y × 10 + (0.5Y + 0.5Y) × D = 1260 
⇒ 5Y + YD = 1260 
⇒ YD = 1260 – 180 
⇒ D = 1080/36 
⇒ D = 30 
Total days in which work completed = 30 
+ 10 = 40 days 
62. Ans. D.  
Let the number of white balls = w, the 
number of green balls = g and the 
number of red balls = r, then 
 =  
⇒ (g + r) = 2w 
⇒ g = (2w – r) 
According to question 
⇒ 
 – 
 = 
 
⇒ 
 = 
 
⇒ 
 = 
 
⇒ 20g = w(w + 2) 
⇒ 20(2w – r) = w(w + 2) 
Let r = 7x, then w = 5x 
⇒ 20(10x – 7x) = 5x(5x + 2) 
⇒ 12 = (5x + 2) 
⇒ x = 2 
So, number of red balls = 7x = 14, 
number of white balls = 5x = 10 and 
number of green balls = (2w – r) = 6 
Hence, 
the 
required 
probability 
= 
 = 
 = 
. 
63. Ans. A.  
Let the number of white balls = w, the 
number of green balls = g and the 
number of red balls = r, then 
 =  
⇒ 
 =  
⇒ w = 10 
Hence, the required probability =

. 
64. Ans. C.  
Let the number of white balls = w, the 
number of green balls = g and the 
number of red balls = r, then 
 =  
⇒ (w + g + r) = 3w 
According to question 
⇒ 
 =  
⇒ (w + g + r) = 5g 
Let (w + g + r) = 15x, then 
w = 5x, g = 3x and r = 15x – 5x – 3x = 
7x 
Also given 
⇒ 
 – 
 = 
 
 
 
 
 
51 
 
⇒

⇒ x = 2 
So, number of red balls = r = 7x = 14, 
number of white balls = w = 5x = 10 and 
number of green balls = g = 3x = 6 
Hence, 
the 
required 
probability 
=

. 
65. Ans. B.  
Let the number of white balls = w, the 
number of green balls = g and the 
number of red balls = r, then g + w = 16 
Given 
 =  
⇒ w = 
 
⇒ g = 16 – w = 16 –

According to question 
⇒ 
 – 
 = 
 
⇒ 
 = 
 
⇒ 
 = 
 
⇒ r2 + 98r – 2272 = 0 
⇒ r2 + 112r – 14r – 2272 = 0 
⇒ r = 14 or –112 
So, g = 
= 
 = 6 and w = 
16 – g = 10 
Hence, the required probability =

66. Ans. C.  
Let the total number of balls in the bag = 
(3 × 5)x = 15x, then 
Number of white balls = 15x ×  = 5x and 
sum of the number of white and red balls 
= 15x ×  = 12x, then 
Number of red balls = 12x – 5x = 7x and 
number of green balls = 15x – 12x = 3x 
Also, 
 – 
 = 
 
⇒ 
 =  
⇒ x = 2 
So, number of red balls = 7x = 14 and 
number of white balls = 5x = 10 
Hence, the required number of balls = 14 
+ 10 = 24.

Given, (Son’s present age – 3 years) + 
(Daughter’s present age – 3 years) + 4 
years = (Amit's present age – 3 years) 
⇒Son’s present age + Daughter’s present 
age = (Amit's present age – 1 year) 
From statement III: (Son’s present age 
+ 2 years) + (Daughter’s present age + 
2 years) – 1 year = (Amit's present age 
+ 2 years) 
⇒Son’s present age + Daughter’s present 
age = (Amit's present age – 1 year) 
This information is already given in 
question, so we cannot answer the 
question from statement III. 
⇒ 
From statement I: Wife's present age = 
Amit’s present age – 7 years 
Wife's present age = 2 × Amit’s son 
present age 
Also, Amit's present age = Wife’s present 
age + 7 years = 2 × Son’s present age + 
7 
⇒Son’s present age + Daughter’s present 
age = (2 × Son's present age + 6 years) 
⇒Daughter’s 
present 
age 
= 
(Son's 
present age + 6 years) 
From statement II: Let 4 years hence 
the age of Amit’s daughter = 6x years, 
then 
4 years hence the age of Amit’s son = 5x 
years 
3 years ago, the age of Amit = (6x – 4 – 
3) + (5x – 4 – 3) + 4 = (11x – 10) years 
Present age of Amit = (11x – 10) + 3 = 
(11x – 7) years 
From statements I and II together: 
6x – 4 = 5x – 4 + 6 
⇒x = 6 
Hence, statements I and II together 
sufficient to answer the question.

Required sum = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. 
74. Ans. C.  
 
Hence, the required ratio = (66 + 60 + 
70 + 54) : (40 + 42 + 30 + 38) = 250 : 
150 = 5 : 3. 
75. Ans. B.  
 
Total cost price of shares = 150 × 40 = 
Rs. 6000 
Total commission while buying = Rs. 200 
Total selling price = 40% of 150 × 50 + 
60% of 150 × 35 = 3000 + 3150 = Rs. 
6150 
Total commission while selling = 8% of 
6150 = Rs. 492 
Hence, the total loss incurred by trader = 
6000 + 200 + 492 – 6150 = Rs. 542. 
76. Ans. D.  
 
Selling amount of shares on Friday = 0.8X 
× × 35 = Rs. 
 
Total commission while selling on Friday 
= [100 + 10% of (
 – 3000)] = (
 – 
200) 
According to question 
– (
 – 200) = 5240 
⇒
 = 5040 
X = 360 
77. Ans. A.  
 
Let he bought the shares at the price 
Rs.x/share, then 
Total cost price for shares = 250 × x = 
Rs. 250x (It must be greater than Rs. 
5000, because x ≥ 40) 
Total commission while buying = Rs. 250 
+ 5% of (250x – 5000) = Rs. 12.5x  
 
 
 
 
55 
 
Total selling price =  of 250 × 50 +  of 
250 × 70 = 7500 + 7000 = Rs. 14500 
Total commission while selling = [100 + 
8% of (7500 – 4000)] + [100 + 8% of 
(7000 – 4000)] = 200 + 8% of 6500 = 
Rs. 720 
So, the total profit = 14500 – (720 + 
250x + 12.5x) = 130 
⇒262.5x = 13650 
⇒x = 52 
Hence, the answer is A.

Average closing price of shares of the 
company XYZ for the given 5 days =

Statement I: 
Passing marks of the examination = 
 
 
 
So, statement I alone is sufficient to 
answer the question. 
Statement II: 
We already know that the difference in 
the marks obtained by Ravi and Ram = 
 
There is no additional information given 
in the statement. So, the value of ‘x’ can’t 
be determined. 
So, statement II alone is not sufficient to 
answer the question. 
Thus, the data in Statement I alone are 
sufficient to answer the question, while 
the data in Statement II alone are not 
sufficient to answer the question. 
So option (a) is the correct answer. 
80. Ans. C.  
Statement I: 
Let, s be the speed of Train A 
According to the question, 
 
 
Also, 
 
 
Using both the equations, we get, 
 
 
 
 m/s 
So, 
 
Therefore, length of Train A = 300 m 
So, statement I alone is sufficient to 
answer the question. 
Statement II: 
Let, s be the speed of Train A 
According to the question, 
 
 
Also, 
 
 
From both equations, we get 
 
 
 m/sec 
So, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
56 
 
Therefore, 
length 
of 
Train 
A 
= 
 
So, statement II alone is sufficient to 
answer the question. 
Thus, the data either in Statement I or in 
Statement II alone are sufficient to 
answer the question. 
So option (c) is the correct answer.

The World Bank and the Commonwealth 
Bank of Australia (CommBank) have 
teamed up to 
enable 
recording 
of 
secondary market bond trading using 
blockchain tech. 
The institutions announced that their 
successful recording of a secondary

• Trading of priority sector lending 
certificates (PSLCs) on the government’s 
e-Kuber portal by banks will attract 
integrated goods and services tax (IGST). 
• However, if the bank has already paid 
Central and State GST for the transaction, 
then it will not have to pay IGST. 
• The clarification comes after the CBIC 
received representations from a number 
of banks on whether GST has to be paid 
for trading of PSLC on the e-Kuber portal 
of the Reserve Bank of India. 
• PSLCs are aimed at encouraging banks 
to lend more to priority sectors, such as 
agriculture, small and marginal farmers 
and micro enterprises. About 40 per cent 
of the total lending of banks has to be to 
these sectors. 
• Banks that do higher lending can issue 
these certificates, which can be bought by 
banks that have a shortfall in their priority 
sector lending. These are traded on the 
RBI’s e-Kuber portal.

121. Ans. E.  
The passage talks about surveys where 
people say that "…hard work is either 
“essential” or “very important” when it 
comes to getting ahead…" and "…external 
factors, such as luck and coming from a 
wealthy family, are much less important". 
So, both options A & D are correct. 
Hence, the correct answer is E. 
122. Ans. C.  
Only option C is correct. The reasons are 
as follows: 
A: 'even playing field' refers to a situation 
in which everyone has the same chance 
of succeeding. So, option A is wrong. 
B & C: "Although widely held, the belief 
that merit rather than luck determines 
success or failure in the world is 
demonstrably false" clearly states that no 
one 
has 
successfully 
implemented 
meritocracy. The phrases 'widely held 
belief' and 'demonstrably false prove 
option C is correct. So, option B is wrong 
and option C is correct. 
D: "…the lottery of birth…" refers being 
born into a wealthy family. So, option D 
is wrong. 
Hence, the correct answer is C. 
123. Ans. B.  
To be factual means to provide us with 
actual details or information rather than 
ideas or feelings about it. The passage 
mentions a belief and then uses facts to 
state the truth. Hence, the correct answer 
is B. 
 
 
 
 
62 
 
124. Ans. D.  
 In the sentence, the tense is incorrect. 
“Being” is not followed by “is”. And out of 
the options, both i and iii can make a 
correct sentence. Option ii is incorrect as 
‘during’ talks about a phase of time while 
‘in’ is used to locate a specific moment in 
time. Thus, the correct answer is option 
D. 
125. Ans. A.  
 The statement is in the simple past tense 
form. Thus, the correct option will be A. 
126. Ans. E.  
 In option i and ii, ‘met on’ and ‘meeting 
of’ are incorrect phrases. In sentence iii, 
the ‘been’ is followed by ‘ing’ form of the 
verb. Moreover, the sentence is correct in 
itself and no correction required. Thus 
option E is the correct answer. 
127. Ans. B.  
 “Because” is used to give reason or a 
cause. Hence, it cannot be used in this 
statement. Option i is incorrect because 
the statement is in present perfect tense 
and ‘was’ is not applicable here. In case 
of option iii, one can’t be chosen ‘within’ 
a prize. One can be chosen for a prize or 
nominated for a prize. Thus, the correct 
option is statement ii. The correct answer 
is option B. 
128. Ans. A.  
The first part that says the Ramayana 
"...takes scant notice of her..." is correct. 
But when the passage says "...essentially 
a 14-year long coma..." it means that 
Urmila was ignored for 14-years. She 
wasn’t actually injured. To hold the fort 
means 
to 
have 
responsibility 
for 
something while someone else is absent. 
There was no attack. Also, the last 
paragraph is describing Kane's version of 
the Ramayana, which is fiction. But the 
inference implies that it is not fictional. 
So, the given inference is definitely false. 
Hence, the correct answer is A. 
129. Ans. A.  
Only option A is correct about 'Uruvi'. The 
reasons are as follows: 
A: The author describes Uruvi as "...of the 
low caste..." and calls it a "...subaltern 
voice...". This means that casteism has 
not been in the Mahabharata originally. 
So, option A is correct. 
B: "Kane’s inspiration for this name 
seems 
to 
have 
come 
from 
some 
references in later Tamil literature, where 
Karna’s 
wife 
is 
named 
Ponnaruvi. 
However, it is conjectured that Ponnaruvi 
was an epithet for either Vrushali or 
Supriya or both." Here, 'this name' refers 
to Uruvi. Clearly, Uruvi had inspirations 
from history. So, option B is wrong. 
C & D: "The Mahabharata speaks of no 
one called Uruvi" which means that there 
was no Uruvi in the original version to be 
ignored or to be unjust. So, option C & D 
are wrong. 
Hence, the correct answer is A. 
130. Ans. D.  
Only option C is the correct option. The 
reasons are as follows: 
A: The passage gives two examples of 
Kane's writings where the protagonist is 
a female in the Mahabharata and the 
Ramayana. The writers are also said to 
"...have passionately taken up the cause 
of feminist revisionist mythology." So, 
option A is correct. 
B: "Kane’s inspiration for this name 
seems 
to 
have 
come 
from 
some 
references in later Tamil literature, where 
Karna’s 
wife 
is 
named 
Ponnaruvi. 
However, it is conjectured that Ponnaruvi 
was an epithet for either Vrushali or 
Supriya or both." indicates that Uruvi was 
not completely fictional. So, option B is 
correct. 
C: "...we deal with not one but two 
subaltern voices..." These two subaltern 
or people of lower status refer to being 
woman and belonging to lower caste. So, 
option C is wrong. 
Hence, the correct answer is D. 
131. Ans. A.  
 In the part C, the presence of indicator 
‘The’ states that this is the beginning of 
the sentence. Part C ends with the adverb 
‘usually’ which means generally. Thus, it 
needs a verb to qualify. Part D follows at 
it makes perfect sense and it begins with 
the verb ‘applied’. The sentence ends with 
the pronoun who. Part B follows as it 
means it is the mentor who moulds. It 
makes perfect sense. Part A ends the 
statement in the logical manner as it 
 
 
 
 
63 
 
concludes the role of the mentor. Option 
A, CDBA, is the correct answer. 
Thus, the correct sentence is: “The word 
mentor is usually applied to the one who 
moulds a young, naive person into a force 
within a field” 
132. Ans. C.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
word ‘it’ work as the dummy subject 
which introduces the sentence. ‘Our’ is a 
determiner which is preceded by noun. 
So, A follows statement B as it is the only 
part which begins with the noun. Thus, BA 
becomes a pair. 
Now, CD makes a pair as it talks about 
how a good mentor can help one to 
navigate one’ career successfully. Now 
CD follows BA as it concludes the 
statement in a meaningful manner. Thus, 
BACD is the correct sequence. Option C is 
the correct answer. 
The correct sentence is: “It is important 
throughout our careers and not just at the 
start as a good mentor can help one to 
navigate one’s career successfully” 
133. Ans. D.  
 Out of the given of options, Option A is 
invalid as ‘do’ does not introduces the 
sentence. Similarly, may is a modal verb. 
Introducing the sentence in the following 
scenario does not make any sense. Thus, 
option B and E becomes invalid. 
Out of option C and D, statements BC 
makes a pair. Statements C ends with the 
modal ‘should’. Now ‘should’ is used to 
give emphasis. It cannot be followed with 
modal 
verb 
‘may’ 
as 
it 
provides 
possibility. Thus, the C must be followed 
by statement D. The correct sequence is 
BCDA. Thus, option D is the correct 
answer. 
The correct sentence is: “A common 
perception when seeking a mentor in that 
area is that we should do it when we are 
new to a profession but that may not be 
when we meet them the most” 
134. Ans. B.  
 Statement A introduces the premise of 
the statement. It talks about the scenario 
in reality. Thus, A is the first part of the 
statement. Thus, option C, D and E gets 
invalid. Now, in option A and B, we see 
statement AB as a pair. 
Statement DC makes a pair as it talks 
about capable grownups needs guidance 
at the workplace. The pair makes perfect 
sense as well. 
Statements AB thus needs to be followed 
by DC to make a complete sense. The 
correct sequence is this ABDC. Option B 
is the correct answer. 
The correct sentence is: “In reality, that’s 
not 
always 
the 
dynamic 
or 
the 
demographic, 
of 
the 
mentor-mentee 
relationship, as capable grownups need 
guidance 
too, 
especially 
at 
the 
workplace” 
135. Ans. D.  
The four sentences are: 
1. The word mentor is usually applied to 
the one who moulds a young, naive 
person into a force within a field. 
2. It is important throughout our careers 
and not just at the start as a good mentor 
can help one to navigate one’s career 
successfully. 
3. A common perception when seeking a 
mentor in that area is that we should do 
it when we are new to a profession but 
that may not be when we meet them the 
most. 
4. In reality, that’s not always the 
dynamic or the demographic, of the 
mentor-mentee relationship, as capable 
grownups need guidance too, especially 
at the workplace. 
Sentence 1, 2 and 3 talks about role and 
function of a mentor in an individual’s 
career. It also mentions where can or 
cannot find a mentor. 
However, statement 4 is a comment of 
the mentor-mentee relationship. Thus, it 
deviates from the functions of the mentor 
to 
the 
relationship 
shared 
between 
mentor and mentee and how even 
grownups need guidance. Thus, option D 
is the correct answer. 
136. Ans. A.  
 
Wretched when used as an adjective, 
means to be in a very unhappy or 
unfortunate state. 
In English grammar, we can use ‘it’ as an
‘empty’ subject. It is ‘empty’ because it
doesn’t refer to anything. In this case, B
is the beginning of the sentence as the
 
 
 
 
64 
 
Troubled, as an adjective, means beset 
by problems or difficulties. 
Injured as an adjective, means harmed, 
damaged, or impaired. 
Downtrodden as an adjective, means 
oppressed or treated badly by people in 
power. 
Elated as an adjective, means very happy 
and excited because of something good 
that has happened, or will happen. 
The last sentence in the stanza says that 
men are miserable, and women should be 
too. This means that women were 
expected to be miserable or unhappy. 
Hence, the correct answer is A. 
137. Ans. D.  
“IAS match” indicates that parents are 
ready to have a groom based on the fact 
that the men have qualified IAS. So, 
option A is correct. 
The statement talks about the 'ambition' 
of the parents. It doesn’t specify what the 
groom or the bride think about the 
marriage. So, option B is correct. 
To descend means to make a sudden 
attack on. The movement of the parents 
being compared to an attack, shows how 
desperate the parents were.so, option C 
is correct. 
The adjective "ambitious" is used for the 
parents. The daughters' opinion is not 
known. So, option D is wrong. 
Hence, the answer is D. 
138. Ans. E.  
"It was in Delhi that he had met Jyoti...". 
Here, he refers to Ashok. Ashok had met 
Jyoti and most likely was introduced to 
her father by Jyoti herself. So, option A is 
wrong. The passage never goes out of the 
way to say that Jyoti doesn't like Ashoke. 
Given that she is the one who introduced 
Ashok to her father, it is very likely the 
she likes Ashok. So, option B is also 
wrong. "Every alternate weekend, he 
would head to Shakti Nagar in Delhi to 
meet her, before hightailing it back to 
Narnaul". Clearly Ashok and Jyoti did not 
live together. So, option C is wrong. 
Hence, the answer is E. 
139. Ans. A.  
To hit it off means to be friendly with each 
other immediately. When you get along 
with 
someone, 
you're 
friendly 
or 
compatible with them. Ashoke "...had not 
exactly hit it off with his boss..." which 
means that Ashok and his boss didn't get 
along very well. So, option I is correct. 
Since it is not specified who followed 
Ashok, option II is wrong. The passage 
only states Jyoti's wish to do journalism. 
So, option III is also wrong. 
Hence, the correct answer is A. 
140. Ans. C.  
The word ‘recent’ is an adjective. It needs 
a noun to modify. Thus, the first blank 
needs a noun. Thus, the possibility comes 
down to option a and c. In the second 
blank, a verb is needed as it talks about 
an idea or theory which depends on 
primacy of communicative activities in 
the classroom. 
Thus, the word ‘rests’ fits in perfectly as 
it means ‘be based on; depend on.’ Out 
of all the combination of options given, 
option C is the correct one. In the first 
blank the word ‘theory’ fits and in the 
second blank the word ‘rests’ fits. 
Option C is the correct answer. 
141. Ans. A.  
 The word ‘huge’ is an adjective. It needs 
a noun to modify. Thus, the first blank 
needs a noun. Thus, the possibility comes 
down word ‘a’ or word ‘c’. 
Option B won’t fit in the blank as word ‘b’ 
is not appropriate for blank 1. In case of 
option C, word ‘f’ will not fit in second 
blank because it does not make any 
sense. Thus, only other option with word 
‘c’ is option A. Both the words ‘c’ and ‘d’ 
fit perfectly in the blanks respectively, 
and it is the correct answer. 
142. Ans. B.  
 The sentence talks about what French 
revolutionaries thought about guillotine 
as a method of the death. Thus, word ‘b’ 
fits perfectly as it means ‘having been 
thought about carefully’. In the second 
blank, words d, e and f fit perfectly. Thus, 
option B is the correct. 
143. Ans. C.  
 The sentence talks about results of 
repayment of loan. The word b won’t fit 
in the first blank as the sentence is in 
simple present tense. So out of the given 
options, the one with word b gets invalid. 
Now let’s look at option E. Even though 
 
 
 
 
65 
 
combination of a-e makes sense, because 
if we withhold a repayment of loan, we 
increase the repayment of loan, the 
combination a-d does not make any 
sense withholding repayment will not 
reduce the amount of loan. Thus, the 
most plausible combination is given in 
Option C. Both the words fit perfectly and 
make complete sense. Thus, Option C is 
the correct answer. 
144. Ans. B.  
 The second blank is preceded by helping 
verb ‘have’. As per rule of grammar, 
have/has +Verb(V3) (Past Participle). 
Thus, word e fits the blank perfectly. 
Similarly, is verb+ing form as the 
sentence is present continuous tense. 
Thus, word a and word c fits perfectly. 
However, there is no option which 
incorporates c with e and a with e. The 
correct combination is offered by the 
option B. Thus, it is the correct answer. 
145. Ans. C.  
The given passage is about expenditure 
in the defence sector of an economy. The 
passage states that it is important for 
national security but is affected by limited 
resources and the demands of other 
sectors. These two points make the ability 
of 
a 
nation 
to 
meet 
its 
defence 
requirements limited. This has been 
explained in option C making it the 
correct answer. 
146. Ans. B.  
‘Ambiguities’ 
is 
the 
plural 
form 
of 
‘ambiguity’ which means the quality of 
being 
open 
to 
more 
than 
one 
interpretation. The meaning of the given 
options are as follows – 
Equivocation – the use of ambiguous 
language to conceal the truth or to avoid 
committing oneself. 
Luminosity – luminous quality. 
Transparency - the quality of being open, 
honest, and direct. 
From the above meanings it is clear that 
while ‘equivocation’ is synonymous to the 
given word, ‘transparency’ is its antonym. 
Thus, option B is the correct answer. 
147. Ans. D.  
As per the given passage, affordability of 
military spending varies on two basis – it 
varies in degree and also over time. Thus, 
statement I is incorrect as it states that 
military spending is constant. 
The passage states that changes in 
degree of affordability showcases the 
changes in what is being perceived as 
threat. This has been stated in sentence 
II, making it true. 
The passage ends with a commentary on 
the US military spending and how it is 
causing 
economic 
distress. 
Thus, 
statement III is also correct. 
Hence, option D is the correct answer. 
148. Ans. B.  
The author is portraying a sense of gloom 
and nothingness in the passage with a 
sense of loneliness. Hence the correct 
option is C. 
149. Ans. B.  
The sentence with the blank states that 
the food that comes from the relationship 
between nature and nurture is a direct 
result of the richness in the differences of 
our regions. Off the given options, 
‘biodiversity’ which means the variety of 
plant and animal life in the world or in a 
particular habitat, a high level of which is 
usually considered to be important and 
desirable, is the best fit word for the given 
blank. Thus, option B is the correct 
answer. 
150. Ans. B.  
The passage clearly blames the condition 
of obesity on lack of good nutritious food. 
(We did this because it was becoming 
clear the world was (and is) facing an 
obesity pandemic — much of the food we 
eat today is bad for health, with no 
nutrition or goodness.) thus, statement I 
is true. 
It also states that the current generation 
is heavily influenced by mass media 
which is also affecting their food habits. 
(We are children of the age of processed 
and factory-grown foods, who have been 
trans-mutated through a deliberate and 
subliminal marketing that has changed 
our habits and our culture of food.) Thus, 
statement II is also true. 
But statement III is false. The passage 
states that the incidence of diabetes is on 
the 
rise 
among 
the 
urban 
poor. 
‘Pandemic’ means prevalent over a whole 
country or the world, which makes the 
 
 
 
 
66 
 
statement incorrect. Thus, option B is the 
correct answer. 
151. Ans. D.  
The given sentence means that in order 
to better protect our wilds and our 
environment, we first need to appreciate 
the offering in the form of a diverse 
variety of nutritious food that nature 
offers. This has been conveyed in option 
D making it the correct answer. 
152. Ans. D.  
The author is describing facts about the 
old caves discovered in France, without 
passing off any judgements. Hence the 
correct option is D. 
153. Ans. B.  
The first paragraph of the passage states 
clearly that one of the biggest reasons 
behind poverty is the financial exclusion 
of the poor and under privileged groups 
in India. The groups lack financial 
education 
which 
leads 
to 
lack 
of 
opportunities for the groups to become 
financially stable. Thus, not only financial 
inclusion is necessary, but also, the 
groups need to financially educated. 
Thus, both statements I and III are 
necessary pre requisites for poverty 
reduction and social upliftment. So, 
option B is the correct answer. 
154. Ans. E.  
All given statements are grammatically 
correct. But option E is contextually 
incorrect. The passage clearly states that 
it is financial ‘exclusion’ that is one of the 
main reasons behind the growth of 
poverty in the country. ‘Inclusion’ as 
mentioned 
in 
option 
E 
implies 
a 
completely opposite school of thought 
making option E contextually incorrect. 
155. Ans. C.  
The passage states – ‘One of the main 
reasons why mass poverty is persisting in 
India is that the problem of financing the 
poor 
still 
remains 
unresolved 
(RBI, 
2011a), …’. This indicates that the reason 
behind mass poverty is the problem of 
access to proper financial sources. It is 
further 
aggravated 
by 
the 
financial 
illiteracy of the poor in the country. 
Hence, option C is the correct inference 
regarding mass poverty as per the 
passage.
