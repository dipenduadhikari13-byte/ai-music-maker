Directions (1-5): Read the following passage carefully. After the passage, a few phrasal verbs are 
listed. Match each phrasal verb with the most appropriate option by selecting the correct letter. 
The Earth is changing. Over the past few decades, human activity has released billions of tons of 
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These emissions (A) temperature rises, rising sea levels, and 
more frequent natural disasters. Climate scientists agree: the damage is real, and it’s accelerating. 
To mitigate the crisis, global leaders introduce policies (B) carbon emissions, promote renewable 
energy, and reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Environmental organizations also take steps (C) waste, 
pollution, and irresponsible consumption through education and grassroots initiatives. 
Some countries, recognizing the urgency, undertook aggressive climate targets years ago. They (E) the 
challenge of building wind farms, transitioning to electric public transport, and conserving forests. 
These examples inspire others to act with similar resolve. 
Still, no strategy is complete without enforcement. Governments around the world now (F) laws on 
industrial emissions and deforestation. Cities (G) standards on construction, vehicle emissions, and 
public energy use, ensuring accountability from both corporations and individuals. 
On the home front, people (H) on energy usage, reduce water waste, and adopt sustainable habits like 
using reusable goods. Restaurants and retailers also (I) their packaging and embrace eco-conscious 
practices. While the impact of each action may seem small, together they matter. 
Sustained action begins to (J) positive outcomes—cleaner air, restored green spaces, and healthier 
communities. Though the journey is long, countries that once (K) difficult reforms now witness 
progress. 
The momentum continues as new groups rise (L) emerging threats—melting ice caps, food insecurity, 
and biodiversity loss. As more governments (M) environmental codes and companies adapt, there’s 
growing hope. 
If the world commits to reduce harmful habits, (N) practical reforms, and uphold the courage of those 
who once undertook this challenge early, we can rewrite our future. It’s time to treat climate change not 
as a distant threat—but as the defining issue of our time.

Directions (6-14): Read the following passage and answer the given questions. 
While social media has ____________ global communication, its misuse continues to raise serious alarms 
across nations. What began as a platform for connection and free expression has, in many instances, 
become a breeding ground for misinformation, cyberbullying, and hate speech. 
According to DataReportal’s 2024 Global Digital Report, over 5.04 billion people worldwide now use 
the internet, with 4.80 billion active on social media. Countries like India, Brazil, and the Philippines 
have seen the highest year-on-year growth in user engagement. However, this increase has also led to a 
surge in harmful online behavior. 
One of the most disturbing trends is the proliferation of hate speech through social platforms. From 
racist slurs to targeted harassment of minorities, social media has enabled hate to spread faster than 
ever before. Algorithms often promote controversial or divisive content because it drives engagement, 
indirectly encouraging inflammatory posts. Studies show that hate-based tweets are 70% more likely 
to be retweeted than neutral ones. 
In response, several countries have introduced legislation to counter this wave of digital toxicity. 
Germany’s Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG), enacted in 2017, is considered a benchmark policy. It 
requires platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to remove “obviously illegal” content within 24 
hours of notification, or face heavy fines. These platforms must also maintain internal records of user 
complaints and content takedown actions for transparency and future audits. 
Country X, recognizing the growing online hostility within its borders, is now adopting a similar model 
to Germany’s NetzDG. By mandating rapid content takedown, establishing grievance redressal 
mechanisms, and enforcing penalties for non-compliance, Country X hopes to curb the unchecked 
spread of hate speech on social media. It has also put in place digital compliance protocols to track 
violations and ensure swift corrective action.

Directions (29-38): Read the following passage and answer the given questions. 
A recent study by the OED Research Center has revealed a surprising contrast between adults and 
children when it comes to practical knowledge. Unlike traditional assessments that focus on aptitude 
and analytical abilities, this research emphasized real-life problem-solving and day-to-day decision-
making. Participants were presented with situations that mirrored common life experiences—such as 
handling minor crises, interpreting emotions, and solving everyday challenges. Surprisingly, the results 
showed that while adults were highly qualified in terms of academic degrees and certifications, their 
ability to navigate practical situations was notably lower than that of children. 
Children, though not formally educated to the same extent, demonstrated remarkable insight, 
adaptability, and intuition. Their responses were realistic, creative, and grounded in observation. They 
approached problems with open-mindedness and curiosity—traits that often diminish in adults due to 
structured thinking and ______________ educational systems. This revealed an important distinction: 
qualifications do not always equate to real-world competence. Adults often rely on theoretical 
knowledge that doesn’t translate well into spontaneous or practical situations, while children, free from 
overthinking and academic pressure, tend to grasp and respond to reality more naturally. 
The study also pointed to deeper issues in how knowledge is taught and measured. Adults, having spent 
years in institutions that emphasize grades and credentials, may lose the ability to learn flexibly or think 
critically beyond a fixed curriculum. On the other hand, children learn through experience, observation, 
and continuous questioning of their surroundings. Their learning is organic, driven by curiosity rather 
than the need for validation through marks or degrees. 
This research challenges traditional views on intelligence and highlights the limitations of measuring 
competence solely through academic achievement. It suggests a shift is needed—both in education 
systems and societal expectations—toward encouraging experiential learning and real-world problem-
solving skills. By valuing curiosity, adaptability, and practical understanding, we may better prepare 
individuals of all ages for the complexities of life. In many ways, the findings remind us that knowledge 
is not defined by age or education, but by one’s ability to engage with the world meaningfully. 
 
Q29. Which of the following best captures the central paradox highlighted in the study? 
(a) Children, despite limited academic exposure, outperform adults in standardized assessments. 
(b) Adults' tendency to overthink is a byproduct of higher intelligence. 
(c) Practical intelligence does not always correlate with formal academic success.

Solutions 
 
S1. Ans.(c) 
Sol. 
• 
(E): “They took on the challenge…” — Correct use of “took on” to mean accepting a responsibility or 
task. 
• 
(K): “Countries that once took on difficult reforms…” — Again, refers to accepting challenging 
actions. 
• 
   Both blanks refer to taking responsibility, aligning perfectly with “took on.” 
 
S2. Ans.(e) 
Sol. 
(A): “These emissions bring about temperature rises…” — Fits the meaning of causing something to 
happen. 
(J): “Sustained action begins to bring about positive outcomes…” — Matches perfectly. 
(N): “Bring about practical reforms…” — Implies causing or initiating change. 
   All three blanks correctly use "bring about" to indicate producing an effect or result. 
 
S3. Ans.(a) 
Sol. 
(B): “Policies to address carbon emissions…” — Fits the need to tackle or deal with a problem. 
(C): “Take steps to address waste, pollution…” — Same context. 
(L): “Groups rise to address emerging threats…” — Clearly means dealing with issues. 
   All blanks represent efforts to tackle environmental challenges, fitting “to address.” 
 
S4. Ans.(b) 
Sol. 
• 
(F): “Governments enforce stricter laws…” — Matches use of regulatory enforcement. 
• 
(G): “Cities enforce stricter standards…” — Again, suitable for local regulations. 
• 
(M): “Governments enforce stricter environmental codes…” — Perfect use in policy context. 
• 
   All three refer to the imposition of more rigorous laws and standards. 
 
S5. Ans.(d) 
Sol. 
(H): “People cut down on energy usage…” — Proper usage indicating reduction. 
(I): “Retailers also cut down their packaging…” — Again, reducing quantity. 
   Both blanks show reduction efforts, making “cut down” the correct choice. 
 
S6. Ans.(d) 
Sol. The passage states: 
“Studies show that hate-based tweets are 70% more likely to be retweeted than neutral ones.” 
This supports inference (d) directly. 
 
 
14 

 
 
S7. Ans.(c) 
Sol. Country X is adopting the NetzDG model to enforce fast takedown and penalties. 
“By mandating rapid content takedown… and enforcing penalties for non-compliance, Country X hopes to 
curb the unchecked spread of hate speech.” 
Hence, (c) is a valid assumption. 
 
S8. Ans.(c) 
Sol. 
• 
(I) is incorrect. The passage largely focuses on negative impacts like hate speech. 
• 
(II) is false. Country X is adopting a similar model, not NetzDG itself. 
• 
(III) is correct as per: 
“…experts stress… promoting digital literacy, encouraging ethical online behavior…” 
 
S9. Ans.(c) 
Sol.  In the passage, “records” is used in the sense of files/documents stored for reference or 
tracking, so “files” is a suitable synonym. 
“Put in place” means to establish or implement something. The opposite of this would be to 
dismantle—meaning to take something apart or undo a system or setup. 
 
S10. Ans.(b) 
Sol.  
• 
(I) is directly supported: 
• 
“Algorithms often promote controversial or divisive content because it drives engagement...” 
• 
(II) is implied in: 
• 
“...experts stress that technology alone cannot solve the problem...” 
• 
(III) is not stated or implied. The passage doesn’t mention delay in implementation as a cause. 
Only (I) and (II) are valid, making (b) the correct choice. 
 
S11. Ans.(b) 
Sol. 
(I) is not mentioned in the passage. 
(II): The passage says, “Algorithms often promote controversial or divisive content because it drives 
engagement…” 
(III) is unsupported by the text. 
 
S12. Ans.(e) 
Sol. All three statements present logical limitations of legal approaches and align with the passage’s 
concluding idea that law is not enough. 
The author notes: 
“Experts stress that technology alone cannot solve the problem.” 
This invites a broader critique of legal measures. 
Hence, Option (e) is correct. 
 
 
15 

 
 
S13. Ans.(b) 
Sol. The passage starts with: 
“While social media has revolutionized global communication…” 
Word meanings: 
• 
(a) complicated – made difficult 
• 
(b) revolutionized – dramatically changed 
• 
(c) curtailed – restricted 
• 
(d) industrialized – adapted for industry 
• 
(e) jeopardized – endangered 
 
S14. Ans.(c) 
Sol. The passage explicitly states: 
“Algorithms often promote controversial or divisive content because it drives engagement, indirectly 
encouraging inflammatory posts.” 
This line shows that engagement-focused algorithms amplify hateful or polarizing content not out of 
malice, but because such content generates more interactions (clicks, shares, comments). 
Let’s eliminate the others: 
• 
(a) and (d) are not mentioned at all. 
• 
(b) is irrelevant to the passage’s focus. 
• 
(e) is not supported — although advertising might influence content, it's not the mechanism 
explained here. 
Therefore, the most accurate choice is (c). 
 
S15. Ans.(c) 
Sol. All three sentences describe moments when a person's attention is captured by something they 
see — an ad, a detail in text, or a painting. 
• 
(I) “her eyes were instantly drawn…” 
• 
(II) “drawn in by a sudden detail…” 
• 
(III) “something… caught her eye” 
These all reflect the idea of noticing something. 
 
S16. Ans.(d) 
Sol. Each sentence revolves around something that is regularly practiced, familiar, or routine: 
• 
(I) Test patterns echo previously seen questions. 
• 
(II) Doctors using abbreviations as a standard practice. 
• 
(III) Wearing ID badges as a routine behavior. 
The idea conveyed is something commonly done or accepted. 
 
S17. Ans.(d) 
Sol. All three sentences show individuals pushing through effort and time to improve or master 
something, despite difficulty: 
• 
(I) She refines her painting daily. 
• 
(II) He practices piano for hours. 
• 
(III) The athlete trains relentlessly. 
The underlying theme is persistent effort — or perseverance.

Step-by-step arrangement: 
1. (E) sets the topic and is clearly the introductory part: 
2. “education is not merely a means to…” 
3. (C) logically follows: 
4. “…a means to employment, but a powerful…” 
So, (E) → (C) 
5. (A) continues the thought: 
6. “…but a powerful catalyst that reshapes mindsets…” 
So, (E) → (C) → (A) 
7. (B) adds another function: 
8. “…dismantles inequality…”

2. (A) follows: 
“…bridged distances like never before, it…” 
So far: B → A 
3. (E) continues with the contrasting clause: 
“…it also challenges us to preserve the…” 
Now: B → A → E 
 
 
17 

 
4. (D) makes sense next:

S29. Ans.(c) 
Sol. The passage’s main contrast lies in the difference between practical intelligence and academic 
achievement. Line: “qualifications do not always equate to real-world competence.” eliminates options (a), 
(b), (d), and (e). 
 
S30. Ans.(d) 
Sol. The passage says: “Their learning is organic, driven by curiosity…” and that children have “insight, 
adaptability, and intuition.” Hence (d) is correct. 
 
S31. Ans.(b) 
Sol. Adults “rely on theoretical knowledge that doesn’t translate well…” and lose flexibility. Hence, (b) 
best explains the underperformance. 
 
 
24 

 
 
S32. Ans.(e) 
Sol. Line: “Their responses were realistic, creative, and grounded in observation.” This confirms (e). Others 
are either incorrect or not mentioned. 
 
S33. Ans.(a) 
Sol. Line: “Their learning is organic, driven by curiosity rather than the need for validation through marks.” 
shows (II) is incorrect. 
 
S34. Ans.(b) 
Sol. 
• 
Statement (I) is true: Line – “their ability to navigate practical situations was notably lower than 
that of children.” 
• 
Statement (II) is true: Line – “This research challenges traditional views on intelligence and 
highlights the limitations of measuring competence solely through academic achievement.” 
• 
Statement (III) is false: The passage does not mention digital tools as a reason for children’s 
superior performance. 
 
S35. Ans.(b) 
Sol. 
• 
(I) is reasonably inferred: Emotional interpretation is part of real-life problem-solving, which 
adults struggle with due to rigidity. 
• 
(II) is explicitly implied: “...may lose the ability to think critically beyond a fixed curriculum.” 
• 
(III) is not implied: The passage does not advocate lowering standards, but restructuring 
education to include experiential learning. 
 
S36. Ans.(c) 
Sol. 
• 
A–4: Children’s problem-solving = “realistic, creative, and grounded in observation” 
• 
B–1: Adults rely on theory = “rely on theoretical knowledge that doesn’t translate…” 
• 
C–3: Traditional systems = “rigid educational systems…” 
• 
D–2: Curiosity-driven learning = “encouraging experiential learning and real-world problem-solving” 
Thus, the correct match is A–4, B–1, C–3, D–2 → Option (c). 
 
S37. Ans.(c) 
Sol.  
• 
From the passage: “traits that often diminish in adults due to structured thinking and rigid 
educational systems.” 
• 
“Rigid” means inflexible or strictly structured, which aligns perfectly with the sentence context. 
Meaning of options: 
• 
(a) inclusive – welcoming and open to all (not relevant here) 
• 
(b) progressive – forward-thinking (opposite) 
• 
   (c) rigid – inflexible, unchanging (correct) 
• 
(d) creative – imaginative (doesn’t fit the negative tone) 
• 
(e) dynamic – constantly changing (opposite)
