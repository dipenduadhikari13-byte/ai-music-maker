S21. Ans.(d) 
Sol. While all options highlight relevant challenges, the core issue was the company’s failure to localize 
its business model to suit the needs and preferences of Tier-3 town consumers. The platform may have 
ignored regional language support, local product demands, or flexible payment options like cash on 
delivery. Successful businesses in such markets typically adapt their approach to the socio-economic 
and cultural landscape. 
 
S22. Ans.(e) 
Sol. Each of the listed points reflects practical and strategic reasons for the company’s success: 
Cost-efficiency (a) directly appeals to courier businesses. 
Affordable pricing (b) allows market penetration among SMEs. 
Smart tracking (c) boosts end-user satisfaction. 
Market need (d) ensures demand. 
Hence, all of these combined contributed to strong adoption and funding. 
 
S23. Ans.(a) 
Sol. Statement I can be assumed because the initiative involves various efforts—EVs, emission control, 
and plastic bans—indicating a serious environmental focus. 
Statement II can also be assumed as industries have expressed concern, showing a clear conflict 
between ecology and economy. 
Statement III cannot be assumed because the opposition to the plastic ban is not specifically 
highlighted over other measures. 
 
S24. Ans.(e) 
Sol. While infrastructure and marketing challenges existed, the primary hurdle was the chatbot’s 
inability to connect with rural users in their native language and its impersonal nature. In regions where 
face-to-face trust matters, such limitations are critical. Therefore, option (e) offers the most direct and 
impactful reason for failure. 
 
S25. Ans.(b) 
Sol. Statement II is a valid hypothesis, as awareness campaigns generally aim to influence behaviour. 
Statement III is a valid hypothesis, given that influencers are mentioned as key outreach partners. 
Statement I cannot be hypothesized confidently—uninstalling devices isn’t mentioned or implied in the 
campaign's objective. 
 
S26. Ans.(b) 
Sol. Statement I is a valid inference as the company paused onboarding and is reviewing its selection 
process, indicating a shift in recruitment strategy. 
Statement II cannot be definitely inferred as no data about the performance of Mumbai and Hyderabad 
candidates is provided. 
Statement III is an extreme assumption and cannot be directly inferred. The company paused the 
process for review, not declared them unskilled.

S27. Ans.(d) 
Sol. Final Arrangement: 
 
Clues: B sits second to the right of the one who has Kite. Three persons sit between A and the one who 
has Kite. One person sits between A and the person who has clock. Two persons sit between the ones 
who has clock and box. E sits immediate right of the one who has box. K sits second to the left of E who 
doesn’t have Kite. 
Inference: Here we get two possible cases: 
 
Clues: As many persons sit between K and the one who has clock as between E and the one who has 
Pen. The one who has pen sits to the right of the one who has box and second to the left of D. E sits fifth 
from one of the extreme ends and has pencil. 
Inference: Above clue is arranged in both the cases: 
 
Clues: Three persons sit between the ones who has Pins and pencils. Nine persons sit between the ones 
who has Pins and radio. The one who has Mobile sits fourth to the right of the one who has radio and 
sits at one of extreme ends of the row.  
Inference: Case 1 gets cancelled here: 
 
Clues: The number of persons sit between the one who has Mobile and A is two more than the number 
of persons sit between K and C. K has Papers. The one who has mobile sits second to the right of I. Eight 
persons sit between H and I. H sits third to the right of F. 
Inference: Now, the final arrangement is: 
 
“B- Mobile” is the correct combination.

of persons sit between K and C. K has Papers. The one who has mobile sits second to the right of I. Eight 
persons sit between H and I. H sits third to the right of F. 
Inference: Now, the final arrangement is: 
 
The one who has pens sits Eighth to the right of F.

of persons sit between K and C. K has Papers. The one who has mobile sits second to the right of I. Eight 
persons sit between H and I. H sits third to the right of F. 
Inference: Now, the final arrangement is: 
 
Number of persons sit to the left of H (3) + Number of persons sit between E and the one who has Mobile 
(9) = 3+9 = 12 persons
