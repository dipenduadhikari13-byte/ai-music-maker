S4. Ans.(e) 
Sol.  
 
 
 
S5. Ans.(b) 
Sol. We know, TSA = 2(lb+bh+hl) 
And, TSA = 94 sq cm 
Volume = l×b×h 
And, volume = 60 cubic cm 
Given, l, b and h are positive and consecutive integers 
We will try different combinations of l, b, h such that their product is 60 and the TSA condition holds. 
Let, l=3,b=4,h=5 
Volume: 3×4×5=60 
And, TSA: 2(lb+bh+hl)=2(3×4+4×5+5×3) 
=2(12+20+15)=2(47)=94 sq cm 
Both conditions follows, so l = 3, b = 4 and h = 5 
Quantity I:  LSA of a cuboid = 2h(l+b) 
= 2×5×(3+4) 
=2×5×7=70 sq cm 
Quantity II: TSA of Cube with side = b = 4 cm 
TSA of a cube = 6×side² 
=6×4² 
=6×16=96 cm² 
So, Quantity I < Quantity II

S6. Ans.(a) 
Sol. Time taken by A = 20 days …i 
Time taken by B = 20×(1+2x%)….ii 
Time taken by C = 20×(1+2x%)(1+x%).....iii 
Now,  
iii = i+ii 
(1+2x%)(1+x%)=1+(1+2x%) 
(1+2x%)(1+x%)=2(1+x%) 
(1+2x%) = 2  
100 + 2x = 200  
100 = 2x  
50 = x  
Time taken by B = 40 days and time taken by C = 60 
Total work = 120 (LCM of 40, 60, 20) 
Efficiency of A = 120/20 = 6 unit per day  
Efficiency of C = 120/60 = 2 unit per day  
Efficiency of B = 120/40 = 3 unit per day  
 
 
S7. Ans.(b) 
Sol.  
 
 
S8. Ans.(b) 
Sol. Set A (4 numbers, smallest × largest = 26) 
26 = 2 × 13  
So, smallest = 2, largest = 13 
Choose two other numbers between 2 and 13 (excluding 2 and 13), such that they are unique. 
Possible two number = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 
Set B (5 numbers, only two are prime numbers) 
Set C (4 numbers, smallest × largest = 23) 
23 is a prime number, so smallest and largest must be 1 and 23, which is the highest number in all three 
sets. 
Possible two prime numbers for set B = 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19  
Two prime numbers of set B = 17 and 19 
All are unique integers, so prime 13 can’t be one of the prime numbers of set B 
So, only (b) is correct.

S9. Ans.(d) 
Sol. Set A (4 numbers, smallest × largest = 26) 
26 = 2 × 13  
So, smallest = 2, largest = 13 
Choose two other numbers between 2 and 13 (excluding 2 and 13), such that they are unique. 
Possible two number = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 
Set B (5 numbers, only two are prime numbers) 
Set C (4 numbers, smallest × largest = 23) 
23 is a prime number, so smallest and largest must be 1 and 23, which is the highest number in all three 
sets. 
Possible two prime numbers for set B = 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19  
There are three sets: A, B, C 
The total number of unique elements = 13 
The total number of prime numbers (n) < 8 
Set A has more prime numbers than Set B 
Set B has exactly two prime numbers 
Set A has four numbers, smallest and largest are 2 and 13 
Set C has four numbers, smallest and largest are 1 and 23, and 23 is the highest in all three sets 
All elements are distinct 
Prime count in Set B: 
Given: Only 2 prime numbers in Set B 
So, Set B = 2 primes 
Prime count in Set A: 
Given: Set A has more primes than Set B 
So, Set A must have ≥ 3 primes 
Set A = 3 or 4 primes 
Set B = 2 primes 
3. Total primes (n) < 8 
So, n can be 6 or 7 
So, C can have either 1 or 2 prime number  
 
S10. Ans.(c) 
Sol. Set A (4 numbers, smallest × largest = 26) 
26 = 2 × 13  
So, smallest = 2, largest = 13 
Choose two other numbers between 2 and 13 (excluding 2 and 13), such that they are unique. 
Possible two number = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 
Set B (5 numbers, only two are prime numbers) 
Set C (4 numbers, smallest × largest = 23) 
23 is a prime number, so smallest and largest must be 1 and 23, which is the highest number in all three 
sets. 
Possible two prime numbers for set B = 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19  
 
 
12 

 
From the condition: 
Set C has 4 numbers 
One of them is prime = 23 
The remaining 3 numbers are consecutive even numbers 
Their sum = 43 
Let the three even numbers be x-2, x, x+2 
So, 
(x-2)+x+(x+2)+23=43 
3x=43-23 
3x = 20 
x=20/3 Not valid (must be integer) 
Try again with different assumption: let 3 even numbers be x, x+2, x+4  
x+x+2+x+4+23=43 
3x=14  
x = 14/3 (Still not valid) 
Even numbers: 4, 6, 10  
Sum = 4 + 6 + 10 + 23 = 43 
non-primes = 4, 6, 10 
Prime in Set C = 23 
So: Set C = {4, 6, 10, 23} 
Now, total primes so far: 
B = 2 primes 
C = 1 prime 
So, far = 3 primes 
Set A can have up to 4 primes 
Assume: Set A = {2, 5, 7, 13}  
Primes = all four 
Now, find sum of primes in Set A: 
2 + 5 + 7 + 13 = 27 
 
S11. Ans.(c) 
Sol. Set A (4 numbers, smallest × largest = 26) 
26 = 2 × 13  
So, smallest = 2, largest = 13 
Choose two other numbers between 2 and 13 (excluding 2 and 13), such that they are unique. 
Possible two number = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 
Set B (5 numbers, only two are prime numbers) 
Set C (4 numbers, smallest × largest = 23) 
23 is a prime number, so smallest and largest must be 1 and 23, which is the highest number in all three 
sets. 
Possible two prime numbers for set B = 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19  
Set A = 2 & 13  
Set B has only 2 prime number  
Set C two number 1 (non-prime number) and 23, in which 23 is one prime number 
Given, C has highest prime numbers 
So, total prime number C = 3 
Possible value of n = 2+2+3=7

Let Piya sold cakes on all three days be 3y 
Cakes sold by Siya on Saturday = 3y/3 = y 
Cakes sold by Piya on Saturday = 3y – 3x 
Given, 20 – x = y – (3y – 3x) 
20 – x = 3x – 2y 
20 = 4x – 2y…..(A) 
The cakes sold by Siya on Monday = 20 
The cakes sold by Siya on Saturday = y 
The cakes sold by Siya on all three days together = 94 
Let cakes sold by Siya on Sunday be Z

Cakes sold by Siya on Saturday = 3y/3 = y 
Cakes sold by Piya on Saturday = 3y – 3x 
Given, 20 – x = y – (3y – 3x) 
20 – x = 3x – 2y 
20 = 4x – 2y…..(A) 
From I 
The cakes sold by Piya on Monday =18 
x = 18 
x value put in (A) 
20 = 4(18) – 2y 
20 – 72 = -2y 
52 = 2y 
26 = y 
Cakes sold by Siya on Saturday = y = 26 
Cakes sold by Siya on Sunday = 81 – 26 - 20 = 35 
Cakes sold by Piya on Sunday = 2x = 36    (Given, Piya sold less cakes than Siya on each day) 
It is incorrect 
From II 
3y – 3x = 90 
y – x = 30 
y = 30 + x 
y value put in A 
20 = 4x – 2(30+x)

From III 
3y – 3x = 21 
y – x = 7 
y = x+7 
y value put in A 
20 = 4x – 2(x+7) 
20 = 4x – 2x – 14

Cakes sold by Piya on Sunday = 2x = 34 
Possible cakes sold by Siya on Sunday = 35  
It is correct.

Sol. Let the weight of C, D & E be c, d, & e respectively. 
The weight of 
 
The weight of B = 56 – 21 = 35 kg 
c + d + e = 200 – 56 
= 144 
Given, 21 < c < 35 
d > 35 
e > d 
From I. Maximum possible weight of C is 34 kg. (correct) 
From II. C’s minimum weight = 22 
D’s minimum weight = 36 
E’s Maximum weight = 144 – 22 – 36 = 86 kg 
Maximum possible weight of E is 74 kg. (incorrect) 
From III. C’s minimum weight = 22 
D’s weight be D kg 
And E’s weight D+2 kg (We can’t take D+1 because the value of D came in fraction.) 
144 = 22 + D + D+2 
D = 60 
E’s weight = 62 kg 
Maximum possible weight of D is 56 kg. (incorrect)

Their speeds are swapped for the same distance 
D = Sb (Ta + 2) 
D = Sa (Tb -2) 
70× Ta = 60 (Ta + 2)
