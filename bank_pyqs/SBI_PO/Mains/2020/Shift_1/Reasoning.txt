to the right of N. So, there will be two possible cases in 
which N sits either on the immediate left or on immediate 
right of Q. 
 
 
Step 3:- From the remaining conditions, M sits on the 
immediate left of brother in law of Q (i.e. R). So case 1 will 
be eliminated as there is no possible sitting for M and R. 
Now continuing with case 2, Son of Q (i.e. B) sits third to 
the right of Q’s brother-in-law (i.e. R) from these condition 
we get our final solution.

Directions (5-7): In this input output question only 
numbers is arranged in each step. Let us understand the 
logic behind it- In each step the numbers are arranged 
 
In step 1: all the even number and odd numbers (of input) 
are multiplied with 2.  
 
Step 2: In this step first two numbers are subtracted, and 
the resultant is multiplied by 2 and again the 2nd and 3rd 
number is added, and the resultant is divided by 2 and so 
on. 
 
Step 3: In this step all the digits are added of the numbers 
marked with arrows. 
 
Step4: The resultant of the multiplication of the digits of 
numbers in the previous step.

Directions (8-11): D, who is L’s mother sits fourth to the 
left of P. The ones who sit at the extreme ends face the 
south direction. G’s soul mate D faces the south direction. 
M, who is the husband of K sits exactly in the middle of the 
bench and faces the north direction. D sits immediate to M. 
From these conditions we have two possible cases- 
 
A sits third to the left of G, who is P’s grandfather and one 
of them who sits immediate to M. L, who is male, is the only 
sibling of K sits exactly between A and P’s cousin, who is a 
female. D’s neighbours are males and face the opposite 
directions. L faces the same direction as G. So new 
arrangement will be- 
 
R, who is the sister of A sits at one of the extreme ends with 
a male member. P is the only son of R and both face the 
opposite directions. So, R is married to L. By these 
conditions case- 2 is cancelled. A is not married and faces 
the same direction as K. There is only one possibility that J 
is sister of P. So final arrangement will be-

Directions (22-26): 
From the given statements, only two employees are junior 
than the one who has 8 years of working experience. 15 
years is the maximum years of working experience which 
means CEO has 15 years of experience. The CEO salary is 
5k less than the square of the smallest two digit number 
which means CEO has 95k salary (100-5=95). At most one 
person is senior to S. Here we have two possible cases i.e. 
case1 and case2. Only two designations are there in 
between the designations of S and P. 
 
 
 
CMO is getting 50K. The sum of the salaries of CLO and CMO 
is same as the salary of the one who has the maximum work 
experience which means CLO gets 45K. The working 
experiences of CMO and CTO are in consecutive years 
which means CMO has 7 years of experience.

R is junior than P. Q is junior than R and having the working 
experience equal to the sum of the digit of the salary what 
R gets and therefor, case 1 gets eliminated here. Hence, Q 
has 5 years of experience. The salary of CTO is less than 
57K which means CFO gets 60 K. The one who is COO has 3 
years more experience than the one who is getting 60K 
which means COO has 13 years of experience. The one who 
has 10 years of experience earns 10K less than U who is not 
CFO. The salary of P is a multiple of 11 which means salary 
of P is 55k (between 50K and 60K)

temperature

a 
little

in 
temperature lead to enormous heat. But (II) can’t 
be inferred as nothing is mentioned about the 
deaths caused by high temperature. 
 
Directions (28-31): Anko was born in the year 1979. The 
difference of age between Anko and Varun is 24 years. 
Trisha’s age is sum of the digits of the year in which Varun 
was born. (i.e. there are two possibilities for the birth year 
of Varun and Trisha that if Varun born in 2013(5years) 
then Trisha born in 2010(8years) and if Varun born in 
1955 then Trisha born in 1998.) The one who likes Red 
colour is 3 years elder to Trisha (two possible cases for 
then one who like Red colour which is 2010/1995).

Mohit’s age is either the last two digits or reverse of the last 
two digits of the year in which Trisha was born. So, in case 
2 age of mohit can be 13 or 31, but only one person is older 
than Mohit. Therefore, age of mohit is 31 in case 2 and 89 
in case 1.

Wednesday which may be either on Thursday, 
Friday, Saturday or on Sunday.  
 
 
From statement II, Riya leave for Puducherry 
either on Wednesday, Thursday or on Friday. 
 
 
And even after combining these two statement we 
don’t get the confirm day on which Riya leave for 
Puducherry as it may be on Thursday or on 
Friday.

33. (d): From Statement 1,           
 
 
 
 
 
From Statement II,  
 
 
 
 
34. (d): From statement I, it is cleared that the one who 
got 75 marks is the person who got second highest 
marks in the examination.  
 
 
 
 
 
As it is also given that Ashu scored more marks 
than Neha and Riya. Ashu does not got the highest 
marks. 
 
 
From Statement II, Riya get more marks than only 
one person. Neha got more marks than Riya but 
not the second highest marks.  
 
 
Neha > Riya >  
 
 
After combining these two we get that Ashu gets 
the second highest marks (75 marks) in the 
examination. 
 
 
 
 
35. (e): As from statement I alone and from statement II 
alone we can’t say that how many persons are 
sitting in the row.  
 
 
Step I: Combining statements, I and II, when all 
are facing north. A, sits third to the left of G, and 
second to the right of M. Both M and A does not sit 
at the end of the row. B sits at the end of the row. 
B sits fourth to the right of K, who sits second to 
the right of A. E, sits between M and A. 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 20: Using the remaining conditions, L sits 
fourth to the left of E and sits at the end of the row.  
 
 
 
 
 
Hence, there are 12 persons are sitting in the row. 
 
Directions (36-40): 
Number of persons standing in ques against counter D and 
counter A is same. The first person standing at counter D 
and A is a female. Number of person at counter B and C is 
less than counter A. Number of person standing at counter 
B is less than counter C. So, from these conditions we get 
that number of persons standing on counter D and A is 4, 
while number of persons on counter C is 3 and B is 2. The 
first person at counter B is a male and he is not married. 
Only one person sits on the east of R, who is married to Q. 
N is a female and is married to K. Two person stands 
between K and J. Q is a female.    
 
P is a male and stands immediately ahead of M who is 
married to J. More than one person stands on the west of P. 
So from these case 2 will be eliminated as no couple stands 
in the same queue. Q stands immediately ahead of S, who 
stands to the west of O, who is a male.  
 
L is married to U, who is a female. L stands on the west of 
T. T is male. The one who stands last at counter A is a 
female and is not married to K. N does not stand in the same 
queue with O. The wife of L does not stand first in the 
queue.

44. (e): Both I and II follows as salary is an important 
factor for encouraging students to opt teaching as 
a career option rather than job and changing the 
eligibility criterion to graduation for being a 
teacher as generally the students choose their 
career option after graduation.  
 
45. (a): Statement (II) follows as by engaging itself in 
manufacturing and distribution of medical 
equipment 
the 
government 
can 
provide 
affordable treatment. But (I) does not follow as it 
is not a practical solution. 
 
 
 
 
Sol. (46-51) 
Let total order received on Sunday of Week II = 100% 
So, it clearly the week two started with Sunday  
Given, Remaining orders which did not delivered in these 
six days of week II are 25 
So, 100% - (16% + 12% + 24% + 20% + 8% + 15%) = 25

Sol. (52 – 53):  
We know, common factor of any prime number be 1 
And HCF of prime number be 1 
So, X = 1 
And from z2 – z – 6 = 0 
We get z = 3 & −2 
 
 
Given, Y = Smallest root of z2 – z – 6 = 0 
 
 
So, Y = −2
