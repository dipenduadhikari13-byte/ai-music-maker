stated by the Dubai Annual Visitor Report 2019,

Since the quarantine introduction, millions of jobs

previous year. Such an increase was driven by 349 
MICE and business events, 97 of which were large 
scale with over 2000 attendees”. 
 
 
Statement (C) can be inferred from last paragraph

global financial crisis.”
