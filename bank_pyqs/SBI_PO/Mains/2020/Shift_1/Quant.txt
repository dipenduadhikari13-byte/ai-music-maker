So, 65 = 
60
100 × 𝑥 + 
40
100 × 50 
 
 
x = 75 
 
 
Required ratio = 75 : 50 = 3 : 2 
 
55.  (c): New marks obtained by D in written paper = 70 
×
15
14 = 75 
 
 
So, C obtained weightage score = 
60
100 × 60 +
40
100 × 50 = 56 
 
 
D obtained weightage score  
 
 
= 
60
100 × 75 +
40
100 × 45 = 63 
 
 
Required percentage = 
63−56
72  × 100 
 
 
= 
7
72 × 100 = 9.72 ≈10% 
 
56.  (a): Total scored of A in written paper = 50 ×
112
100 = 56 
 
 
Let A scored ‘n’ marks in practical paper  
 
 
So,  
 
 
52 = 
60
100 × 56 +
40
100 × 𝑛 
 
 
0.4n = 18.4 
 
 
n = 46 
 
57. (b): From Statement I,  
 
 
 
 
Tray B = 30  
 
 
Rotten eggs in Tray B = 9  
 
 
Fresh eggs in Tray B = 21  
 
 
Tray A,  
 
 
Fresh eggs = 14  
 
 
From Statement II,  
 
 
 
 
Tray A = 20 eggs 
 
 
Fresh eggs in Tray A = 14 
 
 
 
Rotten eggs in Tray A = 6 
 
 
From Statement III,  
 
 
Tray B = 30 eggs 
 
 
Tray A = 20 Eggs 
 
 
Rotten eggs in Tray A =6  
 
 
Fresh eggs in Tray A = 14  
 
 
From Either II or III question can be solved. 
 
58. (e): From Statement I:  
 
 
√8!
8

9
 
 
 
[8!]72×1
8 > [9!]72×1
9  
 
 
[72 𝑖𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝐿𝐶𝑀 𝑜𝑓 8 & 9]  
 
 
[8!]9 > [9!]8  
 
 
⇒ 8! × [8!]8 > [9 × 8!]8 
 
 
⇒ 8! × [8!]8 > 98 × [8!]8 
 
 
Here, 98 is greater than 8! 
 
 
So, Statement I is false 
 
 
From Statement II: 
 
 
On dividing 408842 by 2, 19 and 7 we get 1537 as 
answer.  
 
 
Further 1537 is the product of 53 & 29.  
 
 
So, Statement II is also false 
 
 
From Statement III: 
 
 
Let the total distance be 2x km and let the 
remaining distance he travelled at a speed of y 
km/hr.

So, Statements III is true.  
 
59.  (b): Given, P, Q and R entered into a partnership by 
investing certain amount for 12 months, T months 
and 12 – T months respectively 
 
 
From Statement I,  
 
 
Let P investment = 2X Rs. 
 
 
So, Q investment = 2X ×
150
100 = 3𝑋 Rs. 
 
 
And, investment of R = 3X × 2 = 6𝑋 Rs. 
 
 
So, ratio of investment of P, Q & R = 2 : 3 : 6 
 
 
So, statement I alone not sufficient to give answer 
 
 
From Statement II,  
 
 
Ratio of profit share of (P + R) and Q = (700 – 100): 
100 = 6: 1 
 
 
So, statement II alone not sufficient to give answer 
 
 
From Statement I & Statement II together  
 
 
We have ratio of investment, ratio of profit share 
and investment time periods  
 
 
So, from Statement I & Statement II together we 
can get the answer 
 
 
From Statement I & Statement III together  
 
 
We have ratio of investment, ratio of profit share 
and investment time periods  
 
 
So, from Statement I & Statement III together we 
can get the answer 
 
60.  (e): From Statement I:  
 
 
 Let cost price of article = 100x  
 
 
So, selling price of article = 100x ×
144
100 = 144𝑥 
 
 
And mark price of article = 144x ×
100
80 = 180𝑥  
 
 
And, T = 80% 
 
 
So, statement I alone not sufficient  
 
 
From Statement II: 
 
 
Shopkeeper offers discount of 40% on mark price 
and earns profit of Rs. 16. 
 
 
From Statement I & Statement II together: 
 
 
Selling price of article = 180x ×
60
100 = 108𝑥  
 
 
= 108x – 16 = 100x 
 
 
x = 2 Rs. 
 
 
Cost price = 200 Rs. 
 
 
Form Statement I & Statement III together: 
 
 
180x – 160 = 100x 
 
 
x = 2 Rs. 
 
 
So, cost price = 200 Rs. 
 
 
From Statement II & Statement III together: 
 
 
23 
  Adda247 Publications                        For More Study Material 

 
 
 
180x – 160 = 108x – 16 
 
 
x = 2 Rs. 
 
 
So, cost price = 200 Rs. 
 
 
So, I and II or II and III or I and III sufficient to give 
answer the questions.

So, there we cannot determine any relationship 
between these quantities 
Sol. (62-66) 
For match of team A to B:  
Given total goal score by team A = 2 
So, total point team A should get = 2 × 2 = 4 
So, if team A scored two goals against team B so, team B 
conceded two goals. 
So, actual point gets in this match = 4 + 2 = 6 = team B 
scored three goals  
against team A 
now when team B scored three goals against team A, so 
team A conceded three goals. 
So, actual point scored by team A = 4 – 3 = 1 
Teams

For match of team A to C:  
Actual points scored by team A = 4 + 1 = 5 (here point 1 for 
because one player scored goal outside form D area) 
But given team A has secured four points from this match, 
it means team C scored one goal against team A.  
So, team C actual scored = 2  
But he conceded two goals so team C point = 2 – 2 = 0 
Teams

For match of team B to C:  
Let goal score by team B = x 
So, goal score by team C= x + 1 
Given, one player from team B scored goal outside form D 
area. 
So, total point scored by team B = 2x + 1 
ATQ – 
2x + 1 – (𝑥+ 1) × 1 = 6  
x = 6 
Total goals scored by team C = 6 + 1 = 7 
So, total point scored by team C = 7 × 2 −6 = 8

62.  (d): According to table  
 
 
Rank third of team A  
 
 
Rank second of will be team C 
 
 
And rank first will be team B 
 
 
So, team A gets Rs. 60000 
 
 
So, 3 = 60000 Rs. 
 
 
1 = 20000 Rs. 
 
 
Team B gets = 8 × 20000 = 160000 𝑅𝑠. 
 
 
Team C gets = 5 × 20000 = 100000 𝑅𝑠. 
 
 
So, (a) and (b) both right 
 
63.  (d): Let in each team three players X, Y & Z score goals  
 
 
For maximum sum of goal, player X & Y from each 
team score minimum goal which is equal to one 
goal 
 
 
So, player Z from each team scored maximum 
number of goals 
 
 
= (4 - 2× 1) + (9 – 2 × 1) + (8 – 2 × 1) 
= 2 + 7 + 6

64.  (b): Form the table 
 
 
Required percentage =

10  × 100 = 50% 
 
65.  (b): From the table its clearly shows Team B won the 
tournament by two points as compare to team C. 
Sol (66 -68): 
Let initial mixture milkman has = x liter  
For person P – 
When milk man sold 120-liter mixture and added 80 liters 
of milk and 0 liters of water then the remaining mixture he 
has = 560 liters 
So, x – 120 + 80 = 560  
x = 600 liter 
So, initial milk in mixture = 600 ×

6 = 500 𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 
And initial water in mixture = 600 ×

Milk before selling to R = 480 – 60 + 80 = 500 liters 
 
 
Water before selling to R = 80 – 10 + 10 = 80 liters 
 
 
Required quantity of mixture = 580 liters

r = 35 liters 
 
 
69.  (b): Let total advance classes taken by A = x 
 
 
So, total basic classes taken by A = 2x 
 
 
And. total regular classes taken by A = y 
 
 
Now, 2x + 2y + 3x = 60 × 
20
100 
 
 
5x + 2y = 12 
 
 
When we put x = 1 then y = 3.5 which not satisfied  
 
 
Now we put x = 2 then y = 1 
 
 
Then total number of classes taken by A = 2 × 2 +
2 + 1 = 7 
 
70.  (b): For previous month total hour classes taken by D 
= 60 ×

100 = 3 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠 
 
 
There will be two conditions 
 
 
Either D takes three basic classes in previous 
month  
 
 
Or he takes one advance classes in previous 
month  
 
 
Now in next month for seven hours there will be 
first condition  
 
 
D takes 3 + 1 = 4 basic classes and two advance 
classes (which only follow the given condition 
‘number of basic classes taken by D in next month 
is twice the advance classes’) 
 
 
So, required difference = 4 – 2 = 2 
 
71.  (c): Let basic classes taken by B = x 
 
 
So, number of regular classes taken by B = x  
 
 
And let total number of advance classes taken by 
either B or C = y 
 
 
For B, x + 2x + 3y = 60 ×
25
100 
 
 
x + y = 5 
 
 
For C, 
 
 
Let number of basic classes = n 
 
 
So, n + 4 × 2 + 3𝑦= 60 ×
50
100 
 
 
n + 3y = 22 
 
 
So, only option (c) satisfies the above equation  
 
72. (b): A can complete his work by working “m” hrs in “a” 
days or by working “m-4” hrs in “a+5” days 
 
 
m×a = (m-4) × (a+5) → 5m-4a = 20 
 
 
Possible values of m and a → ((8,5), (12,10)) 
 
 
B complete his work by working “n” hrs in “b” 
days or by working “n-4” hrs in “b+5” days 
 
 
n×b= (n-4) × (b+5) → 5n-4b = 20 
 
 
Possible value of n and b → ((8,5), (12,10)) 
 
 
Now work completed by A & B together in 1 day

81. (b): With respect to paragraph 1, which mentions,” 
Global warming, largely caused by industrial 
development and consumer demands, has been 
causing havoc across the world.” we can infer that 
earth’s climate will change and cause global 
warming. 
 
82. (a): All statements given are correct except statement 
(a). With reference to the first paragraph which 
mentions,” A major solution to mitigate such 
climate changes is to reduce the levels of 
greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, 
which cause this warming. In an effort to try and 
limit this warming, many countries across the 
world are gathering together and agreeing to 
make efforts to limit the rise in temperature to no 
higher than 1.5 degrees by the year 2050. The 
major way to do so is to increase the number of 
plants, trees and forests across the world. They all 
absorb carbon dioxide from the air, and with the

several groups (and governments) in countries, 
notably Philippines and State government in India 
have moved towards more tree plantations. In 
India with its 7,08,273 sq km land area, 21.54% 
has tree cover.” 
 
 
Statement (i) hasn’t been mentioned in the
