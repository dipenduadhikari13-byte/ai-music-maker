Directions (81-87): Read the following passage and 
answer the questions given below. Some words are 
highlighted to help you answer some of the questions. 
New research by Gates Foundation and International 
Development Research Center, published on International 
Women’s Day, has revealed the magnitude of the unpaid care 
burden that women across the world bear and which has only 
gotten worse since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. It has 
been found that women across the world are spending 30 
hours per week exclusively on childcare - almost a second full-
time job. In India, both women and men reported an increase 
in unpaid work at home and a decrease in time spent on paid 
work, but that extra time translated to more rest for men and 
more time spent on chores for women. This research report 
came after two other childcare reports launched earlier in 
March, both by the World Bank, on the importance of 
investing in childcare to build human capital, and an update 
on how laws and regulations ___________(I)___________ women’s 
economic inclusion, including childcare. 
12 

 
This new research was produced in partnership with the 
International Development Research Centre (IDRC), the 
Growth and Economic Opportunities for Women (GrOW) East 
Africa initiative, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It 
had a specific focus on supporting women in low- and middle-
income countries. At the beginning of the research, we 
challenged ourselves to think if the childcare issue is a high-
income country problem or a global problem. One of the 
hypotheses I had in my mind was that high-income countries 
tend to have nuclear families and may find childcare more 
pronounced as an issue. But what the report shows is that this 
is a universal problem. Describing the fallout from the closure 
of childcare centers in low-income settlements, “this has three 
effects: first, the women who were sending those children to 
the childcare centers have difficulty in working; second, the 
women from childcare centers have lost their jobs; and third, 
childcare burden shifts to adolescent girls. The last effect is 
particularly worrying as this will have long-term effects for 
this generation.”  
The shift of the burden to adolescent girls is worrying as they 
already shoulder a disproportionate amount of care burden 
compared to their male counterparts, in many low- and 
middle-income countries. I feel that a lot of the global 
conversations on childcare have been focused on high-income 
countries, but this is equally a priority for low- and middle-
income countries. “It is surprising how little attention 
childcare has received over the years. The pandemic has laid 
bare the fissures and fractures in our society, which has been 
organized on the backs of women and women’s unpaid work. 
With everybody around the world now thinking about how to 
stimulate the economy, women need to be central to 
economic recovery plans and progress.  
 
Q81. According to new research by Gates Foundation,

Directions (88-92): Read the following passage and 
answer the questions given below. Some words are 
highlighted to help you answer some of the questions. 
 
The nitrogen requirements of cotton are well understood and 
have been extensively studied since 1887, with practical 
guides, decision support systems, models and recent reviews 
providing information on the importance of providing cotton 
crops with a sufficient supply of nutrients and improving 
nitrogen use efficiency. Given that the financial return to the 
grower depends on both the cotton quantity and quality and 
the growing importance of the latter, this review focuses 
specifically on information and knowledge about the effect of 
nitrogen application level on fiber quality. Although the 
United Nations has indicated that there will be a dramatic 
slowdown in population growth, it is still estimated that the 
world population will increase. However, despite this 
slowdown in population growth, the demand for food, fiber 
and fuel continues to grow.  
As the global agricultural and arable land has remained fairly 
stable, any increase in such demands needs to be met by 
either increasing the areas of land that may not be suitable 
for crop production or else by increasing yield, which can be 
achieved in a number of ways, including multiple cropping 
and reduced fallow periods, improved tillage and soil fertility. 
Due to the fact that most soils do not provide sufficient 
nitrogen for the economical production of fiber and seeds, the 
additional 
supplementation 
of 
nitrogen, 
phosphorus, 
potassium fertilizers is the key input in maintaining 
productive, profitable, and sustainable cropping industries. It 
has been stated that, together with water, nitrogen is the 
single most important growth-limiting factor, excluding 
weather, for crops. A study conducted in 1990 showed that 
pulling the plug on nitrogen fertilizer usage would result in 
a slump in the yield of cotton by 37%.  
Nevertheless, as only a fraction of the nitrogen applied is 
taken up by the crop, there is a need to improve fertilizer use 
efficiency as excessive levels can result in substantial losses as 
well as potential environmental, ecological and health risks. 
In terms of fiber, despite the fact that cotton’s share of the 
global fiber market is decreasing, cotton still remains one of 
the most important textile fibers in the world, with its 
production and consumption picking up the threads. Cotton 
is a global commodity that is either grown or used in virtually 
every country in the world and is traded in the form of fiber, 
yarn, fabric, or finished goods. Cotton is sought after by 
consumers as it is a natural fiber with excellent comfort 
against the skin, moisture absorption, the soft hand feels and 
versatility.  
 
Q88. What methods does the author recommend for 
preserving cropping industries as productive, profitable, 
and long-term? 
(a) By retaining status as a relatively steady worldwide 
agricultural and farming land. 
(b) By increased fortification of nitrogen, phosphorus, and 
potassium supplements. 
(c) By expansion of land areas to accommodate any increase 
in market requirements.  
(d) Both (a) and (b) 
(e) Only (a) and (c) 
 
Q89. Choose the most appropriate antonym of the word

Q103. 
(A) Sri Lanka is gearing up to host the Fifth Bay of Bengal 
Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic 
Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Summit. This special occasion makes 
it imperative for BIMSTEC leaders to reinforce their 
commitments and efforts in building the momentum of 
collaborations in the Bay of Bengal region for the security and 
development of all. 
(B) _____________________________? 
(C) The economic and strategic significance of the Bay of 
Bengal is also growing rapidly with a re-emergence of the idea 
of the ‘Indo-Pacific’ region. This notion assumes that the 
growing security connections between the Western Pacific 
and the Indian Ocean regions are creating a shared strategic      
space.

increased over the last year due to increases in raw materials, 
which account for the majority of the total cost of 
construction; as a result, developers will be forced to raise 
prices. 
(B) Since the job market is now seeing a lot of churns, higher 
attrition has been leading to better increments, therefore, 
recruiters are predicted to offer better increments in the next 
months, while some are expected to dole out ordinary 
advancements. 
(C) _____________________________? 
(a) Peanut oil from Siberia might enable the world's largest 
edible oil importer to make up for a shortfall in vegetable oils, 
which has been exacerbated by Indonesia's decision to 
restrict palm oil exports and a reduced soybean harvest in 
South America. 
(b) Recruiters reported new and replacement staffing in their 
organizations until June of this year as their anticipation of 
returning to normalcy is generating a strong hiring sentiment, 
since there has been pent-up demand across sec tors. 
(c) A captain's formative reputation can be difficult to shake, 
in contrast to how players are evaluated only on the basis of 
runs scored or wickets taken, regardless of whether or not 
these performances resulted in a win. 
(d) India has agreed to purchase several tonnes of Russian 
sunflower oil at a record-high price for shipments in April, as 
edible oil prices in the country increased exponentially after 
supplies from competing Ukraine were cut off.

its 
advertising 
platform's 
algorithm 
disproportionately promotes one political party in the 
country. 
(b) Representatives present at the conference defended 
themselves by claiming that the algorithm is designed to 
determine which adverts perform better than others and that 
the company has no involvement in the process. 
(c) The committee members also demanded an explanation 
from the officials on the privacy violation and voiced worry 
that the technology appears to be prejudiced toward 
promoting and awarding inflammatory content. 
(d) On developments in regard to the long-pending question, 
India has welcomed the talks between the President and the 
Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the largest grouping of 
legislators elected from the north and east to consult on the
