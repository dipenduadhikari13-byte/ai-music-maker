Q36. Study the following information in which a 
statement is followed by five conclusions, read  carefully 
and answer the question below- 
 
Statement: Other than being an essential source of water for 
Indian agriculture, the monsoon plays a critical role in 
flushing out pollutants over Asia. However, recently increased 
pollution — particularly from coal burning — could 
potentially weaken this ability of the monsoon. 
 
Which of the following can be deduced from the given 
statement? 
 
(a)The unusually high concentration of particulate matter in 
the last few days in India clearly shows that air pollution is 
emerging as a big problem. 
(b)As the climate gets warmer and frequency of rains reduces, 
such spurts in coarse particles making breathing difficult will 
become a new normal and the government is not waking up 
to the alarm. 
(c)Both the periodicity and duration of dry spells in the 
country were rising as total rainfall events in a year had fallen 
even though the average rainfall in a year has not changed 
much, a direct consequence of climate change. 
(d)The annual average rainfall has remained the same 
because the frequency of heavy downpours increased in the 
past two decades. 
(e)The air quality in the region deteriorated because of dust 
storms in western India, particularly Rajasthan.
