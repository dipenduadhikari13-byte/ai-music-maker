Directions (1-5): Read the following passage carefully and answer the following questions.
As soon as the pandemic struck, one of the very first things that we stopped doing was visiting restaurants or cafés. But some of us foodies here didn’t stop dreaming about digging into good food. Yes, we also started cooking ourselves a lot more, but the idea of savouring butter chicken (with an extra dollop of butter, of course!) or a bowl of ramen, that, too, whipped up a culinary expert, in a safe and hygienic environment, was too hard to resist. So, when we heard about these angels in flesh and bone, called home chefs, we couldn’t help but shed a tear of joy. Which brings us to the question—have you tuned in to Season 2 of HT Neighbour’s Kitchen yet? Powered by Glen India, this web series revolves around Tanmay (played by VedaantSaluja), a 20-something promising young chef. In the second edition, he can be seen donning the hat of a home chef in Mumbai during the pandemic. And because it’s set in the backdrop of the pandemic, the story is utterly relatable.
In the previous season, Tanmay was shown as living in Delhi and studying at a top culinary school. During his stay there, he befriended an elderly couple, called Mr&Mrs Ghosh, who also became his closest friends and confidantes. The plot struck a chord with the young and the old alike, garnering thousands of likes and shares.
In Mumbai, Tanmay’s life is hard. After all, starting a business during a global catastrophic event can be challenging, both emotionally and financially. The orders are few and far between. Tanmay doesn’t even have money to pay his rent. So, he ends up getting a flatmate called Akshay (played by Amit Vikram Pandey), a rising Instagram star and a die-hard foodie from Delhi. But, most importantly, he’s completely opposite of Tanmay. To spice it up is their landlord, who has a no-nonsense attitude, and Tanmay’s father, who doesn’t approve of his endeavours and wants him to come back home. As episode after episode unfolds, we see Tanmay’s relationships thrive – with his flatmate, his father, his landlord, and a lady love! Go watch it if you love cooking, and are a perfectionist at that. Watch it even if you aren’t Speaking about Season 2, Anand Rai, General Manager-Marketing, Glen Appliances, says, “I would like to see a good response to this series. We feel that the first season has created some awareness about new audiences, and the second one will further strengthen our relationship with them.”

Reading comprehension
Directions (6-10): Read the following passage carefully and answer the following questions.
While the entire episode may be seen as yet another internal dispute of the elite, it has created a crisis of credibility for the royal family — for charges of racism from within are hard to counter. The British monarchy has gone through its share of crises — from more personal controversies around Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage to political challenges, including a republican strain which sees the institution as antiquated and out of line with the democratic spirit of modern times. But few episodes will do as much damage to the credibility of the monarchy as an institution as the interview of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Megan Markle, who have walked away from the royal family to begin life anew in the United States (US).
In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, the couple made a series of charges against the royal family — the most damaging of which was MsMarkle’s disclosure that when they were about to have a child, members of the royal family had conversations about “how dark the skin might be when he is born”. Harry confirmed the conversation, expressing his shock — but made it clear subsequently that it was neither Queen Elizabeth nor Prince Philip who made the remark. MsMarkle also spoke about how there were times when she did not want to live anymore, and painted a picture of an apathetic and insensitive royal establishment.
While the entire episode may be seen as yet another internal dispute of the elite, it has created a crisis of credibility for the royal family — for charges of racism from within are hard to counter. It has led to a divide between allies on either side of the Atlantic, with the popular mood in the US firmly with the young couple while the mood in the United Kingdom remains more ambivalent. But at the core, the issue is about how the monarchy as an institution is increasingly losing its traditional, political, and now popular legitimacy.
