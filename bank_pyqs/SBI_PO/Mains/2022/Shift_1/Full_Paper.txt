Cotton acreage in India during the current year has fallen by 10% as cotton growers have moved on the
cultivation of other cash crops. This is the result of the cotton glut in world markets post-September 11 and the
consequent slowdown in the world economy. But this scenario brought with it benefits to one segment of the
industry - yarn manufacturers - as they get higher prices for their produce. Some yarn manufacturers had stocked
up low priced cotton last year. The combined effect of all this is evident in the rise in net profits and net margins
of yarn manufacturers.
Assumption: The farmers will again grow cotton next year due to the increased price of cotton yarn.

Directions: Read the following passage and select the correct answer.
Alka had lost her job during the lockdown and started a new business to support herself. She was
providing tiffin service to the people who had depended on restaurants for daily food and were facing a problem
due to the lockdown. Because of the apt timing and identification of need, her business had hit the ground
running. It hadn't even required a lot of investment and she used her savings from the job to start it so she had no
debt hanging on her. The business flourished for over an year but then as the lockdown opened, she saw a drastic
reduce in demand for her tiffins. Alka surveyed her customers and found out that the local restaurants were
offering a similar meal at a lower cost than her.

Read the following passage carefully and answer the following questions:                                 
At one level, colonialism simply means the establishment of rule by one country over another. In the
modern period, Western colonialism has had the greatest impact. India’s past has been marked by the entry of
numerous groups of people at different times who have established their rule over different parts of what
constitutes modern India today. The impact of colonial rule is distinguishable from all other earlier rules because
the changes it brought in were far-reaching and deep. History is full of examples of the annexation of foreign
territory and the domination of weaker by stronger powers. Nevertheless, there is a vital difference between the
empire-building of pre-capitalist times and that of capitalist times. Apart from outright pillage, the pre-capitalist
conquerors benefited from their domination by exacting a continuous flow of tribute. On the whole, they did
not interfere with the economic base. They simply took the tribute that was skimmed off the economic surplus
that was produced traditionally in the subjugated areas.              
For instance, it changed the very laws of the land. (A) Every policy was geared towards the strengthening
and expansion of British capitalism. (B) It changed not just land ownership laws but decided even what
crops ought to be grown and what ought not to be. (C) In contrast, British colonialism which was based on
a capitalist system directly interfered to ensure the greatest profit and benefit to British capitalism. (D) It
meddled with the manufacturing sector. It altered the way the production and distribution of goods took place. It
entered into the forests. It cleared trees and started tea plantations. It brought in Forest Acts that changed the lives
of pastoralists. They were prevented from entering many forests that had earlier provided valuable forage for
their cattle. The box carries a brief account of the impact of colonial forest policy in North-East India. 
Colonialism also led to the considerable movement of people. It led to the movement of people from one part to
another within India. For instance, people from present-day Jharkhand moved to Assam to work on the tea
plantations. A newly emerging middle class particularly from the British Presidency regions of Bengal and
Madras moved as government employees and professionals like doctors and lawyers moved to different parts of
the country. People were carted in ships from India to work on other colonized lands in distant Asia, Africa, and
the Americas. Many died on their way. Most could never return. Today many of their descendants are known as
people of Indian origin.

 Read the passage given below and then answer the questions given below the passage. Some
words may be highlighted for your attention. Pay careful attention.
Australia, which is globally the fifth largest exporter of cotton, is looking at India to emerge as a consistent and
major buyer of its commodity. An eight-member delegation representing the Australian Cotton Shippers’
Association held meetings in Ludhiana, Mumbai, and Coimbatore between February 27 and March 3. “We came
to promote and enhance use of Australian cotton,” Matthew Bradd, chairman of Australian Cotton Shippers’
Association, told The Hindu here on Thursday. “We want India to become a consistent buyer of our cotton.”
Australia has nearly 1,200 cotton growers and can supply even small quantities of cotton to India. China
purchased over 30% of Australia’s cotton production last year. However, this was lower than its usual
purchase.“India is a big market for cotton and spinners in India said they have had good experience with
Australian cotton,” he said. According to Hamish McIntyre, vice-chairman of Cotton Australia and a member of
the eight-member delegation, India used to purchase 5% to 7% of cotton produced in Australia every year. In
2016, it shot up to nearly 23%. This was mainly because of the drop in production in India last year. Indian
textile mills can use Australian cotton as a blend to produce high value garments. The area under cotton and
production was increasing in Australia, he said. K.N. Viswanathan, vice-president of Indian Cotton Federation,
said that Australia cotton is known for its quality and strength. However, its production was limited until last
year.India is the largest producer and consumer of cotton globally. But, India’s imports are also more to meet the
need for long staple cotton. For Indian spinners, with failure of monsoon in many places this year where long
staple cotton is grown, Australian cotton can be an option. At present, Australian cotton and Indian cotton prices
seem to be almost at par. The Indian cotton industry faced a number of problems. Most of them did not have
www.prepp.in
managerial leadership and technical knowledge except the financial capability so had to face the chill wind
almost constantly. The result was the frequent changes of managing agents and liquidation of the companies on
the one hand, and the oligarchic concentration of the mills to a few agency firms on the other hand. The Indian
cotton textile industry had to face stiff competition from Britain’s most internationally aggressive cotton
industry. And, in the process, British industry suffered a lot at the hands of the Indian industry. But some events
of the 1920s eroded the competitiveness of the Indian industry. After the end of the World War I, Japanese
exports of cloth to India acted as a big threat to the Indian industry though such Japanese exports were held in
check in the 1920s. But it reappeared after 1930 despite a high tariff rate of 50 p.c. Most of the labourers of the
cotton mills were unsophisticated in the sense that they were recruited from the small peasants and agricultural
labourers. As a result, permanent textile labour force could not arise. Textile machinery and technology used in
this industry were imported before the World War I and it continued till the outbreak of the World War II.
However, India could not procure modern equipments from America and Japan because technology of the cotton
textile industry was heavily Manchester-biased.
What is the central idea of the passage?
Correct Option - 3
Problems of the Indian cotton industry.
1.
