Directions (71-78): Read the passage given below and answer the following questions. 
Information technology has revolutionized the modern world, transforming how individuals and 
organizations communicate, learn, work, and entertain themselves. From the internet and mobile devices 
to cloud computing and artificial intelligence, IT has transformed virtually every aspect of human activity. 
As such, it has created new opportunities and challenges, raising questions about privacy, security, 
intellectual property, and the digital divide. One of the most significant implications of IT is its impact on 
the way we communicate and access information. With the advent of the internet and social media, 
individuals can now connect with others, share their ideas, and access vast amounts of information from 
anywhere in the world. This has empowered individuals, democratized knowledge, and enabled new 
forms of collaboration and innovation. However, it has also created new risks, such as the spread of 
misinformation, cyberbullying, and online harassment. 
21 

 
Another key implication of IT is its impact on the economy and the nature of work. With the rise of 
automation and artificial intelligence, many jobs are becoming redundant, while new ones are emerging. 
This has led to a widening skills gap and increased demand for digital skills. Moreover, the growing use of 
freelancers and remote work has blurred the boundaries of traditional employment, raising questions 
about labor rights and the gig economy. As such, policymakers and businesses must work together to 
ensure that IT creates inclusive, equitable, and sustainable economic opportunities for all. With the 
internet and various software tools, we can now access and process vast amounts of data quickly and 
efficiently. This has led to improvements in areas such as healthcare, education, and business. For 
example, doctors can now access patient data remotely and collaborate with specialists from around the 
world, while businesses can use data analytics to optimize their operations and reach new customers. 
However, with the benefits come concerns. One of the biggest challenges is data privacy and security. As 
more and more personal information is stored and shared online, the risk of data breaches and identity 
theft also increases. In addition, there are concerns about the impact of technology on jobs and the 
economy. As automation and artificial intelligence become more prevalent, there is a risk of job 
displacement and a widening income gap between those who possess the necessary skills and those who 
do not. In addition to its impact on communication and information access, information technology has 
also transformed the business landscape. From e-commerce to supply chain management, digital 
technology has revolutionized how companies operate and interact with customers. By leveraging data 
analytics and machine learning algorithms, businesses can now make data-driven decisions, personalize 
customer experiences, and optimize their operations for maximum efficiency.
