Directions (15-21): Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions given below it. 
Certain words have been printed in bold to help you locate them, while answering some of the 
questions.  
 
In some ways we already do: every time we spend our cash we are making an active choice about the 
companies we support and the practices we endorse. Today, when corporations can be more influential 
than entire states, where we put our pounds is where the power lies. The problem is, so it is difficult to 
confidently make an informed choice. 
Consider this: the retail manufacturing industry is the second most polluting industry on earth, second only 
to oil. According to Annie Leonard, an expert in overconsumption, only 1% of the materials used to produce 
our consumer goods are still in use six months after sale. Somewhere, the value of craftsmanship and of 
provenance has been lost. Price and speed are trumping value. However, the tide is turning. Increasing 
awareness around these issues has led to a rise in what is known as conscious consumption, a movement 
of people who seek out ways to make positive decisions about what to buy and look for a solution to the 
negative impact consumerism is having on our world.

This is a growing tribe: a third of UK consumers claim to be very concerned about issues regarding the 
origin of products. A study from YouGov and the Global Poverty Project revealed that 74% of those 
surveyed would pay an extra 5% for their clothes if there was a guarantee workers were being paid fairly 
and working in safe conditions. If you’re thinking that 5% doesn’t sound like a lot, consider the fact that 
the fashion industry could take a staggering 125 million people out of poverty by adding only 1% of its 
profits to workers’ wages. 
Issues such as equal pay, environmentally conscious manufacturing processes, prevention of counterfeit 
goods, human trafficking, responsible farming practices and overproduction of goods are all at the 
forefront of consumers’ minds when making these choices. In an increasingly open, digital world where 
authenticity is the buzzword of choice, businesses must keep up with growing demands for ethical 
behaviour and transparency in everything from employee rights and gender discrimination to the supply 
chain. 
In studying for my PhD, I researched product supply chain transparency in depth, looking at technologies 
to improve information about products and the global network of people and resources that fuel them. I 
believe technology is the key to dealing with the challenges created by consumerism. Open data, social 
networks and mobile tech can change the game. Groundbreaking technologies could enable transparency 
in supply chains, which is why this year I have __(I)___on turning my findings into a social enterprise to 
empower businesses to take steps to being open.

(d) As Customers are taking an increasing interest in the ethical practices of those from whom they buy 
(e) None of these 
 
Q18. According to the author how can we tackle the impact of consumerism?  
(a) By using technology in order to increase transparency in supply chains 
(b) By repleting the resources which were otherwise depleted due to overconsumption  
(c) By increasing the lifespan of the products so as to reduce the consumption. 
(d) By spending extra for the products if there was a guarantee worker 
were being paid fairly 
(e) None of these
