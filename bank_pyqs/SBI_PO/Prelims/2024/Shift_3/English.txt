Directions (29-36): Read the following passage and answer the given questions. 
A recent study conducted by a French researcher in 2023 and 2024 has shed light on the remarkable 
expansion of the kids’ clothing, toy, and merchandise industry. The research highlights that the 
Compound Annual Growth (CAG) rate in this sector is swelling to 20.1%, indicating a significant surge 
in consumer demand. If this upward trajectory continues, the entire industry is projected to reach a 
massive $32 billion valuation by 2030. 
One of the key drivers behind this growth is the increasing spending capacity of parents who are willing 
to invest in high-quality clothing, sustainable toys, and premium merchandise for their children. Modern 
parents are not only focusing on functionality but also on fashion, comfort, and safety. Many firms are 
capitalizing on this trend by introducing eco-friendly materials, innovative designs, and interactive toys 
that enhance learning. 
Additionally, the rise of e-commerce has provided ample space for emerging brands to establish 
themselves in this lucrative market. With digital platforms making shopping more convenient than ever, 
both established companies and new startups are _____________________ to cater to the growing demand. 
The study also revealed that social media plays a crucial role in influencing parents' purchasing 
decisions, with many brands leveraging influencer marketing and targeted advertisements to reach 
their audience effectively. 
Moreover, sustainability has become a focal point in this industry. Parents are now looking for 
biodegradable toys, organic clothing, and ethically sourced materials, pushing companies to adopt more 
responsible production practices. Firms that align with these values are seeing a surge in customer 
loyalty and brand reputation. 
While the research highlights promising growth, it also points out challenges such as fluctuating raw 
material prices and increasing competition. Companies that focus on innovation, sustainability, and 
customer engagement are likely to thrive in this rapidly expanding space. As the industry moves toward 
2030, businesses that can adapt to evolving consumer preferences will be at the forefront of this 
booming market.
