Directions (19-26): Read the following passage and answer the given questions. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic not only reshaped the toy industry for children but also triggered an 
unexpected trend among adults — a growing attachment to soft toys. As lockdowns and social 
distancing measures confined people to their homes, many adults turned to soft toys as a source of 
emotional comfort and stress relief. The sense of familiarity and warmth offered by these toys provided 
a much-needed emotional anchor during uncertain times. The increased focus on mental health and 
self-care led to a noticeable rise in soft toy purchases among adults, alongside other comfort-focused 
items like weighted blankets, calming puzzles, and mindfulness books. 
In 2020, toy sales increased by 16%, with soft toys playing a significant role in this growth—not only 
among children but also among adults. Adults began seeking ways to reconnect with their inner child, 
using soft toys as a tool for emotional regulation and relaxation. The tactile comfort of plush toys helped 
reduce anxiety, promote better sleep, and provide a sense of security. Educational toys and products 
supporting emotional well-being gained traction among adults as well, but soft toys stood out as a sign 
of emotional healing and personal comfort in an unpredictable environment. 
 
 
Interestingly, even social media influencers have contributed to this trend. One popular influencer 
recently admitted feeling the pressure to ________________ her collection of soft toys, worried that it might 
affect her online image. However, her audience rallied around her, encouraging her to embrace her love 
for soft toys and continue sharing her playful side. This highlights a broader shift in cultural attitudes, 
where emotional vulnerability and self-comfort are becoming more accepted and even celebrated. 
Zahn, a behavioral expert, noted that the emotional attachment to soft toys reflects a deeper need for 
psychological stability. "The act of holding or hugging a soft toy activates the brain's calming response," 
Zahn explained. As the market stabilized in 2021, the demand for soft toys among adults remained 
strong due to their emotional value. The trend toward eco-friendly products also became evident, with 
adults showing increasing interest in soft toys made from sustainable materials. 
Adults have increasingly started to book their toy purchases in advance to secure limited-edition and 
themed products during sales events. The growing influence of streaming platforms on product 
discovery and marketing has further shaped adult buying patterns. Soft toys have become a lasting 
symbol of emotional security and inner peace, reflecting a broader shift in how adults approach 
emotional well-being post-pandemic. The soft toy market, once dominated by children, now reflects a 
growing cultural acceptance of adults embracing their inner child.
