Directions (8-16): Read the following passage and answer the given questions. 
In recent years, the population of pigeons in urban areas has swelled significantly, raising concerns about 
the health risks they pose. Studies indicate that pigeon populations in major cities have increased by over 
30% in the past decade, largely due to human feeding habits and the lack of natural predators. These birds, 
often seen flocking in public squares, rooftops, and balconies, have adapted remarkably well to city life. 
One of the primary reasons for their unchecked growth is the continuous feeding by humans. In places like 
London and New York, feeding pigeons has led to colonies numbering in the hundreds of thousands, 
creating sanitation and health challenges. 
Pigeons are not just harmless city dwellers; they bring with them a host of potential health risks. They build 
their nests in ______________________ of our homes, leading to an accumulation of droppings, feathers, and 
parasites. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that pigeon 
droppings contain over 60 types of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, and viruses. These pathogens can 
cause respiratory diseases like histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and psittacosis, particularly in individuals 
with weakened immune systems. Additionally, pigeon droppings are highly acidic, leading to the gradual 
erosion of buildings, monuments, and infrastructure. 
One of the biggest concerns is the spread of mites, ticks, and fleas from pigeons to humans. A study 
conducted in Barcelona in 2022 found that 70% of pigeons carried ectoparasites that can infest homes and 
trigger allergic reactions. Furthermore, their presence in large numbers contributes to increased airborne 
allergens, worsening conditions for people with asthma or respiratory issues. 
Efforts to control their population should focus on reducing their dependence on human feeding and 
making nesting areas less accessible. Many cities have started implementing deterrent measures such as 
installing anti-roosting spikes, netting, and automated bird-repelling devices. Some regions, like Venice and 
Singapore, have introduced fines for feeding pigeons, leading to a 25% reduction in pigeon numbers over 
five years. 
The unchecked growth of pigeon populations is like a battery of problems waiting to explode. If we do not 
take preventive measures, we might find ourselves caught in a thread of complications that could have 
been easily avoided. It is time to address this issue seriously, balancing conservation with public health and 
urban hygiene.

(I) Pigeon populations in urban areas have seen a rapid increase, primarily due to factors such as human
