Directions (10-18): Read the following passage and answer the given questions. 
The latest retail inflation data once again highlights the continuous volatility in food prices, which 
continues to impact overall inflation and economic growth, particularly personal consumption. In 
February, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained almost unchanged from the previous month at 
5.09%. However, food inflation, measured by the Consumer Food Price Index, rose by 36 basis points to 
8.66%. Among food items, vegetable prices remained the most concerning, with inflation in this 
category surging to 30.3% year-on-year—an increase of 315 basis points from January. Cereal inflation, 
the most significant component in the food index, remained high at 7.6%, only slightly lower than 
January’s 7.83%. 
The widely consumed potato-onion-tomato group _______________________ vegetable inflation. Potato 
prices, which had declined by nearly 2% in January, shot up to 12.4% inflation. Onion prices surged by 
22.1%, while tomato inflation rose by nearly 400 basis points to reach a six-month high of 42%. Data 
from the Department of Consumer Affairs' daily monitoring dashboard indicates no relief, with average 
retail prices of potatoes, onions, and tomatoes as of March 14 being 21.3%, 41.4%, and 35.2% higher, 
respectively, compared to a year ago. 
Despite government interventions, such as a three-month-old ban on onion exports, prices remain 
stubbornly high. The outlook remains grim, with onion production in the 2023-24 horticulture year 
expected to decline by over 15.6% and potato production estimated to drop by nearly 2%, as per the 
Ministry of Agriculture’s First Advance Estimates released on March 7. Additionally, water storage levels 
at 150 reservoirs were at 40% of capacity as of March 14, lagging behind both the 10-year average and 
last year's levels. This shortfall is particularly severe in the southern region, where the deficit is 29%. 
Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Michael Patra recently warned that high food inflation is 
weighing heavily on private consumption, which constitutes 57% of GDP, especially in rural areas. To 
ensure balance in economic growth, inflation must be controlled. With elections approaching, 
policymakers face the challenge of preventing a worsening economic situation in the coming months by 
implementing more regulated measures and improving the handle of food price stability to ensure 
economic resilience.
