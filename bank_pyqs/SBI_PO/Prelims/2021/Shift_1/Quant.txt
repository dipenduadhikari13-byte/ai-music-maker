Study 
the 
following 
information and answer the questions below: 
 
Eight persons A, B, C, D, E, G, H and K sit in a linear

one of the immediate neighbours of HR. The one 
who is Executive sits exactly between K and the 
one who is CEO. D sits third to the left of the one 
who is Executive. D sits adjacent to A who is not 
CEO. Same number of persons sit to the left of A 
and right of the one who is Manager. C and the one 
who is Senior executive are immediate neighbours. 
Three persons sit between H and the one who is
