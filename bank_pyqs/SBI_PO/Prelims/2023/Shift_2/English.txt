Q1. What was the common reason behind every environmental protest in India? 
Read the given passage and answer the following questions based on that. 
Almost 40 years ago — a group of peasants in a remote Himalayan village stopped a group of loggers 
from felling a patch of trees. Thus was born the Chipko movement, and through it the modern Indian 
environmental movement itself. The first thing to remember about Chipko is that it was not unique. It 
was representative of a wide spectrum of natural resource conflicts in the 1970s and 1980s — 
conflicts over forests, fish, and pasture; conflicts about the siting of large dams; conflicts about the 
social and environmental impacts of unregulated mining. In all these cases, the pressures of urban and 
industrial development had denied local communities to access the resources necessary to their own 
livelihood. 
In the West, the environmental movement had arisen chiefly due to the desire to protect endangered 
animal species and natural habitats. In India, however, it arose out of human survival. This was an 
environmentalism of the poor, which married the concern of social justice on the one hand with 
____________________ on the other. It argued that present patterns of resource use disadvantaged local 
communities and devastated the natural environment. 
Back in the 1970s, when the state occupied the commanding heights of the economy, and India was 
close to the Soviet Union, the activists of Chipko and other such movements were dismissed by their 
critics as agents of Western imperialism. Slowly, however, the sheer persistence of these protests 
forced the state into making some concessions. In 1980, a Department of Environment was 
established at the Centre, becoming a full-fledged Ministry a few years later. New laws to control 
pollution and to protect natural forests were formed. There was even talk of restoring community 
systems of water and forest management. Meanwhile, journalists and scholars had begun more 
systematically studying the residue (I) of environmental degradation on social life across India. In 
1991 the Indian economy started to liberalise. The dismantling of state controls was in part welcome, 
as it had stifled innovation and entrepreneurship. Unfortunately, the votaries of liberalisation 
mounted an even more savage attack on the environment than did the proponents of state socialism. 
(a) Personification of natural elements as the divine spirits in Indian civilization 
(b) Deprivation of local communities from the basic necessities of livelihood. 
(c) Awareness of environmental consequences on living beings’ lives 
(d) The belief that leading a rudimentary lifestyle is the rightful way of living 
(e) None of these 
 
Q2. What was/were the difference(s) between the western environmental movements and Indian
