Q11) [hiking] 
currencies over the last couple of years. While 
other (Q12) [trickling] market currencies 
such as the Russian rouble and the Brazilian 
real are down more than 20 per cent this 
year, the rupee is lower by just 6 per cent. 
This follows a strong performance in 2014, 
when the Indian currency lost just 1.2 per 
cent against the greenback. It is obvious that 
the rupee is in a sweet spot (Q13) [peculiar] 
to its emerging market peers, which have 
been hit hard by the (Q14) [ascent] in 
commodity prices. India, on the other hand, 
has benefited from this fall. The crash in 
crude prices combined with the checks on 
gold imports have helped (Q15) [recede] the 
current account deficit to just 1.27 per cent of 
GDP. Strong foreign inflows — from both 
portfolio and direct investments — have 
pushed India’s forex reserves to $351 billion; 
we are among the few countries that have 
(Q16) [considered] to increase forex reserves 
since the middle of last year. These reserves 
provide the Indian central bank with (Q17) 
[ammunition] to protect the rupee from short-
term volatility that may arise once the Federal 
Reserve goes through with its long-anticipated 
rate hike. Since the Fed has given financial 
markets sufficient time to (Q18) [discern] the 
move, a 25 basis points move is not likely to 
cause too much turbulence. True, some short-
term money will flow out of the equity 
markets; foreign portfolio investors have 
(Q19) [turned] net sellers since November. 
But long-term investors are likely to stay put 
due to the better growth (Q20) [contrariety] 
of Indian companies. The superior real yield, 
falling inflation and a stable rupee also make 
a strong case for staying invested in Indian 
debt instruments.
