Instructions [1 - 6 ]
Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions given below it. Certain words/phrases have been printed in bold to help
you locate them while answering some of the questions.
India is rushing headlong toward economic success and modernisation, counting on high- tech industries such as information
technology and biotechnology to propel the nation toprosperity. India’s recent announcement that it would no longer produce
unlicensed inexpensive generic pharmaceuticals bowed to the realities of the World TradeOrganisation while at the same time
challenging the domestic drug industry to compete
with the multinational firms. Unfortunately, its weak higher education sector constitutes the Achilles’ Heel of this strategy. Its
systematic disinvestment in higher education inrecent years has yielded neither world-class research nor very many highly trained
scholars, scientists, or managers to sustain high-tech development.
India’s main competitors especially China but also Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea — are investing in large and differentiated
higher education systems. They are providingaccess to large number of students at the bottom of the academic system while at the
same time building some research-based universities that are able to compete with theworld’s best institutions. The recent London
Times Higher Education Supplement ranking of the world’s top 200 universities included three in China, three in Hong Kong,three in
South Korea, one in Taiwan, and one in India (an Indian Institute of Technology at number 41.— the specific campus was not specified).
These countries are positioningthemselves for leadership in the knowledge-based economies of the coming era. There was a time
when countries could achieve economic success with cheap labour andlow-tech manufacturing. Low wages still help, but
contemporary large-scale development requires a sophisticated and at least partly knowledge-based economy.India has chosen that
path, but will find a major stumbling block in its university system. India has significant advantages in the 21st century knowledge race.
It has a large high ereducation sector — the third largest in the world in student numbers, after China andthe United States. It uses
English as a primary language of higher education and research. It has a long academic tradition. Academic freedom is respected.
There are asmall number of high quality institutions, departments, and centres that can form the basis of quality sector in higher
education. The fact that the States, rather than the Central Government, exercise major responsibility for higher education creates a
rather cumbersome structure, but the system allows for a variety of policies and approaches. Yet the weaknesses far outweigh the
strengths. India educates approximately 10 per
cent of its young people in higher education compared with more than half in the major industrialised countries and 15 per cent in
China. Almost all of the world’s academic systems resemble a pyramid, with a small high quality tier at the top and a massive sector at
the bottom. India has a tiny top tier. None of its universities occupies a solid position at the top. A few of the best universities have
some excellent departments and centres, and there is a small number of outstanding undergraduate colleges. The University Grants
Commission’s recent major support of five universities to build on their recognised strength is a step toward recognising a
differentiated academic system and fostering excellence. At present, the world-class institutions are mainly limited to the
Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and perhaps a few others such as the All India
Institute of Medical Sciences and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. These institutions, combined, enroll well under 1 percent
of the student population. India’s colleges and universities, with just a few exceptions, have become large, under-funded, ungovernable
institutions. At many of them, politics has intruded into campus life, influencing academic appointments and decisions across levels.
Under-investment in
libraries, information technology, laboratories, and classrooms makes it very difficult to provide top-quality instruction or engage in
cutting-edge research.The rise in the number of part-time teachers and the freeze on new full-time appointments in many places have
affected morale in the academic profession. The lackof accountability means that teaching and research performance is seldom
measured. The system provides few incentives to perform. Bureaucratic inertia hampers change.Student unrest and occasional faculty
agitation disrupt operations. Nevertheless, with a semblance of normality, faculty administrators are. able to provide teaching,
coordinate
examinations, and award degrees. Even the small top tier of higher education faces serious problems. Many IIT graduates,well trained
in technology, have chosen not to contribute their skills to the burgeoning technology sector in India. Perhaps half leave the country
immediately upon graduation to pursue advanced study abroad — and most do not return. A stunning 86 per cent of students in science
and technology fields from India who obtain degrees in the United States do not return home immediately following their study. Another
significant group, of about 30 per cent, decides to earn MBAs in India because local salaries are higher.—and are lost to science and
technology.A corps of dedicated and able teachers work at the IlTs and IIMs, but the lure of jobs abroad and in the private sector make
it increasingly difficult to lure the best and brightest to the academic profession.Few in India are thinking creatively about higher
education. There is no field of higher education research. Those in government as well as academic leaders seem content to do the
“same old thing.” Academic institutions and systems have become large and complex. They need good data, careful analysis, and
creative ideas. In China, more than two-dozen higher education research centers, and several government agencies are involved in
higher education policy.India has survived with an increasingly mediocre higher education system for decades.Now as India strives to
compete in a globalized economy in areas that require highly trained professionals, the quality of higher education becomes
increasingly important.India cannot build internationally recognized research-oriented universities overnight,but the country has the key
elements in place to begin and sustain the process. India will

need to create a dozen or more universities that can compete internationally to fully participate in the new world economy. Without
these universities, India is destined to remain a scientific backwater.

Instructions [11 - 16 ]
Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions given below it. Certain words/phrases have been printed in bold to help
you locate them while answering some of the questions.
Asia’s rapid rise is the most successful story of economic development in recent history. Income per capita reached nearly $5,000 in
purchasing power parity terms in 2010. Investment rates averaged 35% of GDP over the decade. The number of people living below the
$1.25-a-d ay poverty line fell by 430 million
between 2005 and 2010. With such achievements at a time when much of the rest of the world struggles with austerity measures and
economic recovery, Asian leaders might be tempted to switch to autopilot. But closer examination of the region’s economic and social
prospects soon reveals many paradoxes.The world’s fastest growing region remains home to nearly half the world’s extreme poor.
While Asia has made tremendous inroads in the fight against poverty, not enough of the region’s economic prosperity is reaching its
poorest people.In urban areas of China, for example, the Gini coefficient (a measurement used to calculate inequality) has risen more
than 35% since 1990. Nearly half a billion Asians still lack access to safe drinking water and infant mortality in many nations is more
than 10 times higher than the levels seen in developed economies.While “Factory Asia” may be true for manufacturing and information
technology services, vast number of its people are illiterate and unemployed. Its financial sector is underdeveloped, with many people
having no access to simple banking, let
alone other financial services. Asia’s future prosperity, and the eradication of extreme poverty, will require much more than simply high
growth. Growth must be accompanied by a narrowing of inequality.It is essential to balance the region’s economic expansion with more
inclusive policies. Cut off by poor roads, telecommunications, or government policies that don’t allow them to easily borrow or save,
Asia’s poor and vulnerable are watching the chasm between rich and poor grow ever wider. That gap in prosperity can aggravate
simmering social, economic and political tensions.Asian governments can help stem widening inequality by creating better conditions
for the private sector to take the lead on economic expansion, continuing to promote economic diversification, and by spending on
social services, education and healthcare, and regional road, sea and air networks that will open more
opportunities to more people.There are areas where western governments can help too. By investing in
infrastructure alongside public lenders, they can help attract much larger sums from the private sector.Asia can also capitalise on
financial lessons from the west, particularly when it comes to setting banking regulations, strengthening regional links, and promoting
bonds to better utilise Asian savings. When describing where Asia stands today, it’s useful to remember that what we are witnessing is
not the emergence of Asia, but rather the re-emergence of Asia.In 1820, Asia accounted for about 60% of total global output, with China
and India together accounting for nearly half of global GDP. This was followed by nearly two centuries of economic decline once the
western industrial revolution took hold – at rend that, since the information age, has been solidly reversed. By implementing structural
reforms and opening their economies, China and others have rapidly emerged as engines of the global economy.The recent Asian
Development Bank study suggests that we could see Asia producing over half of global GDP by mid-century, and 3 billion Asians would
be considered part of the rich world, with capita income levels equal to that of Europe today.Carefully calibrated government support
can help steer Asia’s economic potential, reducing political risks while opening new markets to help move the west beyond the current
crisis. In the long run, an Asian economy built on sustainable growth can support greater levels of trade, and generate growth in
tourism. Conversely, a weaker Asia presents a host of threats to the west’s future growth and prosperity.Embracing globalisation and
regional co-operation has helped bring developing Asia success. By further strengthening this process by focusing on greater access
and inclusion within economies, and pursuing sustainable development and improved governance, an “Asian century” is both plausible
and within reach.But policies that worked when Asia was low-income and capital scarce are less likely to work today and unlikely to
work in the future. Asia’s leaders must devise bold and innovative national policies while pursuing regional and global cooperation.
Long-term prosperity will depend on the intensity of resource use,including water and food, and success in managing the region’s
carbon footprint. Asia’s challenges remain formidable, and its future prosperity must be earned. The right policy choices today could
indeed make this the “Asian century”, but this is far from preordained.

Women ____1____ up half the world’s population and yet represent a staggering 70% of the world’s poor. We live in a world in which
women living in poverty face gross ____2____ and injustice from birth to death. From poor education to poor nutrition to ____3____ and
low pay employment, the sequence of discrimination that a woman may suffer during her entire life is unacceptable but all too
common. Millennium Development Goal 3 is to promote gender equality and empower women. This MDG is critical for ____4____
poverty and improving prospects for women. But how can women break gender based stereotypes to minimise discrimination and
____5____ gender based violence when they are trapped in societies with socio-cultural practices which routinely discriminate them
from having equal opportunities in education, health and livelihood? These women are invisible and the ____6____ in their way prevent
them from accessing the most basic human rights and needs. The outlook is bleak. Women make up 70% of the world’s working hours
and ____7____ only 10% of the world’s income and half of what men earn. This leads to greater poverty, slower economic growth and a
____8____ standard of living. In developing countries, millions of women also die each year as a result of gender-based ____9____. This
deep-rooted gender discrimination creates a bleak outlook for women in developing countries. For millions of girls living in poverty, it is
often those closest to them who work against the child’s interests and their immediate environment is often ____10____ and
sometimes, downright harmful. Parents arrange marriages when you are a child. Neighbours say, if you are a girl, you must limit your
activities to your home. Friends say, it is OK not to go to school.

Study the following information carefully and answer the questions.
For a room, the rate of painting is Rs. 3200 per square metre. The rate of carpeting per square metre is 120% of that of tiling. The cost
of decorating the room Is 14 times to that of carpeting on the floor. The cost of electrification is 75% of that of carpeting the floor. The
rate of tiling on the floor is 125% of that of painting. The dimensions of the room are 6 m x 6m x 5m.
51. What is the ratio of the cost of painting the four walls of the room and that of decoration ?
A    10 : 63
B    10 : 61
C    10 : 21
D    21 : 10
E    None of these
Answer: A
Explanation:
Cost per square metre,
Rate of painting = 3200
Rate of tiling = 
 = 4000
Rate of carpeting = 
 = 4800
Rate of decorating = 14 * 4800 = 67200
Area of the 4 walls = 2 * 5 * (6 + 6) = 120 sq. metre
Area of the floor = 6 * 6 = 36 sq. metre
=> Expenditure on decoration = 36 * 67200 = 2419200
Expenditure on painting = 120 * 3200 = 384000
 Required ratio = 384000 : 2419200 = 10 : 63
 
 
 
 
52. What will be the total cost of decorating the room and tiling the floor when the four walls have also been tiled to a height of

E    None of these
Answer: B
Explanation:
Cost per square metre,
Rate of painting = 3200
Rate of tiling = 
 = 4000
Rate of carpeting = 
 = 4800
Rate of decorating = 14 * 4800 = 67200
Area of tiles on the walls = 2 * 0.25 * (6 + 6) = 6 sq. metre
Area of the floor = 6 * 6 = 36 sq. metre
Cost of decorating = 36 * 67200 = Rs. 2419200
Cost of tiling = (36 + 6) * 4000 = Rs. 168000
 Total cost = 2419200 + 168000 = Rs. 2587200
53. What will be the total cost of painting, carpeting, decoration and electrification of the room if the dimensions of the room be 21
mx 42 mx 27 m?
A    Rs. 30888000
B    Rs. 8388000
C    Rs. 80388000
D    Rs. 40888000
E    None of these
Answer: C
Explanation:
Cost per square metre :
Rate of painting = 3200
Rate of tiling = 
 = 4000
Rate of carpeting = 
 = 4800
Area of 4 walls of the room = 2 * 27 * (21 + 42) = 3402 sq. metre
Area of the floor = 21 * 42 = 882 sq. metre
=> Cost of painting = (3402 + 882) * 3200 = Rs. 13708800
Carpeting = 4800 * 882 = Rs. 4233600
Decoration = 4233600 * 14 = Rs. 59270400
Electrification = 
 * 4233600 = Rs. 3175200
 Total expenditure = 13708800 + 4233600 + 59270400 + 3175200 = Rs. 80388000
54. What will be the cost of tiling the floor of the room if the rate of tiling be increased by 75% and the dimensions of the room be

55. If the length of the room be increased by 20%, breadth by 32% and height by 12%, then what will be the total cost of painting of
the four walls of the room and tiling the floor?
A    Rs. 76996.80
B    Rs. 67996.80
C    Rs. 67796.80
D    Rs. 76796.80
E    None of these
Answer: A
Explanation:
Cost per square metre
Rate of painting = 3200
Rate of tiling = 
 = 4000
New length = 
 * 6 = 7.2
New breadth = 
 * 6 = 7.92
New height = 
 * 5 = 5.6
=> Area of the 4 walls = 2 * 5.6 * (7.2 + 7.92) = 169.344 sq. metre
Area of the floor = 7.2 * 7.92 = 57.024 sq. metre
=> Cost of painting = 3200 * 169.344 = Rs. 541900.8
Cost of tiling = 4000 * 57.024 = Rs. 228096
 Total cost = 541900.8 + 228096 = Rs. 76996.8
56. What will be the total cost of carpeting, decoration, electrification and tiling the floor if the rate of painting be doubled ?

E    None of these
Answer: B
Explanation:
Cost per square metre
Rate of painting = 6400
Rate of tiling = 
 = 8000
Rate of carpeting = 
 = 9600
Rate of decorating = 14 * 9600 = 134400
Rate of electrification = 
 = 7200
Now, total cost :
Carpeting = 6 * 6 * 9600 = Rs. 345600
Decoration = 6 * 6 * 134400 = Rs. 4838400
Electrification = 6 * 6 * 7200 = Rs. 259200
Tiling = 6 * 6 * 8000 = Rs. 288000
 total cost = 345600 + 4838400 + 259200 + 288000 = Rs. 5731200
57. What will be the cost of decoration of the room if its cost be increased by 25% ?
A    Rs. 60480
B    Rs. 604800
C    Rs. 6048000
D    Rs. 6448000
E    None of these
Answer: C
Explanation:
Cost per square metre,
Rate of painting = 6400
Rate of tiling = 
 = 8000
Rate of carpeting = 
 = 9600
Rate of decorating = 14 * 9600 = 134400
Area of the floor = 6 * 6 = 36 sq. metre
Expenditure on decoration = 134400 * 36 = Rs. 4838400
 Expenditure after 25% increase = 
 * 4838400 = Rs. 6048000

B    85%
C    65%
D    68%
E    69%
Answer: A
Explanation:
Country III :
Total employees = 
 * 86000 = 6880
Female employees = 6880 -

Country IV : 
Total employees = 
 * 86000 = 12040
Female employees = 12040 - 
 * 56000
= 12040 - 10080 = 1960
Country V : 
Total employees = 
 * 86000 = 14620
Female employees = 14620 - 
 * 56000
= 14620 - 10080 = 4540
 Total female employees = 160 + 1960 + 4540 = 6660
Average = 
 = 2220

A    13 feet
B    15 feet
C    9 feet
D    12 feet
E    14 feet
Answer: C
Explanation:
L is smaller than only statue M, => M is the tallest statue and L is the second tallest.
Statue O is smaller than statue N and Statue O is longer than statue P, => N > O > P
Combining above statements, we get :
 M > L > N > O > P
Height of M = 20 feet and O = 11 feet
P is the smallest statue and its height will be less than 11, thus height of P = 9 feet

Answer: D
Explanation: r/>
N is not an immediate neighbour of H and one of the immediate neighbours of L is K who is facing north, => O is standing to the
immediate left of H.
The immediate neighbours of O face opposite directions with respect to each other, => since H faces north, the other neighbour has to
face south (which can't be K), thus N faces south direction and stands between L and O. Thus, K stands at extreme left end facing
north.
The persons standing at the extreme ends face the same direction, => M faces north
The immediate neighbours of J face north, => I also face north.  
Not more than four persons are facing north, => L, O and J face south direction.
L is fourth to the right of J.
=> Ans - (D)

116. What is the code of ‘shine’ in a certain code language?
I. In that code language ‘shine was peeled off is written as ‘& # @ 9’ and ‘no paint but shine’ is written as ‘7 5 # 8′.
II. In that code language `try the new shine’ is written as ’13 # 0′ and ‘we try the new’ is written as ‘6013’.
A    if the data in Statement I alone are sufficient to answer the question, while the data in Statement II alone are not
sufficient to answer the question.
B    if the data in Statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question, while the data in Statement I alone are not
sufficient to answer the question.
C    if the data either in Statement I alone or in Statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question.
D    if the data even in both Statements I and II together are not sufficient to answer the question.
E    if the data in both Statements I and II together are necessary to answer the question.
Answer: C
Explanation:
I : The common word in both the inferences is 'shine' and the common code = '#'
Thus, 'shine' is coded as = '#'
Thus, statement I alone is sufficient.
II : The common words in both inferences are 'try', 'the' and 'new' coded as = '0' or '1' or '3'
=> Only word left in first inference is 'shine' and only code left is '#'
Thus, 'shine' is coded as = '#'
Thus, statement II alone is sufficient.
 Either statement alone is sufficient.

if the data in Statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question, while the data in Statement I alone are not
sufficient to answer the question.
C    if the data either in Statement I alone or in Statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question.
D    if the data even in both Statements I and II together are not sufficient to answer the question.
E    if the data in both Statements I and II together are necessary to answer the question.
Answer: C
Explanation:
I. N is son of H. J is mother of Z. N and Z are cousins. C is husband of J.
=> Since, Z and N are cousins, thus J is sister of H.
Also, C is husband of J, => C is brother-in-law of H.
Thus, I alone is sufficient.
II. L is father of C. A is mother of D. L is married to A. H is wife of D. J is wife of C.
=> L is husband of A and their children are C(male) and D
Also, H is wife of D, => C is brother-in-law of H.
Thus, II alone is sufficient.
 Either statement alone is sufficient.
=> Ans - (C)

D    if the data even in both Statements I and II together are not sufficient to answer the question.
E    if the data in both Statements I and II together are necessary to answer the question.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Both statements mean the same thing :
∴
 
 
www.prepp.in 
The man starts from point A and travelled for 3 m towards east, from there he turned right towards south to reach M, and then travelled
west for 6 m to reach O. Then again turned right to reach P and finally stopped at B.
Thus, point A is 5 m to the east of point B.
 Either statement alone is sufficient.

A    if the data in Statement I alone are sufficient to answer the question, while the data in Statement II alone are not
sufficient to answer the question.
B    if the data in Statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question, while the data in Statement I alone are not
sufficient to answer the question.
C    if the data either in Statement I alone or in Statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question.
D    if the data even in both Statements I and II together are not sufficient to answer the question.
E    if the data in both Statements I and II together are necessary to answer the question.
Answer: B
Explanation:
I : More than four but less than ten students scored more than that of B. B’s rank is an odd number
=> B's rank can be 5 or 7 or 9.
Thus, I alone is insufficient.
II : The rank of C is 16th from the last, => C's rank from top = (25+1) - 16 = 10th. 
B got more marks than C. Only two students are there between B and C.
=> B's rank from top = 7th
Thus 6 students scored more marks than B.
 II alone is sufficient.
=> Ans - (B)

A    if the data in Statement I alone are sufficient to answer the question, while the data in Statement II alone are not
sufficient to answer the question.
B    if the data in Statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question, while the data in Statement I alone are not
sufficient to answer the question.
C    if the data either in Statement I alone or in Statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question.
D    if the data even in both Statements I and II together are not sufficient to answer the question.
E    if the data in both Statements I and II together are necessary to answer the question.
Answer: E
Explanation:
I : B is facing outside. C is to the immediate left of B. D is second to the right of C. A is to the immediate left of E.
=> C is facing outside and directions in which A and E are facing are unknown. Thus, possible arrangements are :
Thus, I alone is insufficient.
II : D is to the immediate right of A. Both D and A are facing towards the centre. D and B are immediate neighbours of each other.
Similarly, II alone is also insufficient, hence by combining both statements, we get :
Thus, C is sitting second to the left of A.
 Both statements together are sufficient.
=> Ans - (E)
