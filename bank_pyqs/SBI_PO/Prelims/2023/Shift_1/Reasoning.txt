Directions (21-23): Each passage is 
followed by a set of five statements. 
Answer according to the directions given 
for each question. 
 
 
There's a lot of outrage on the Internet 
about 
migrants 
coming 
ashore 
and 
immediately taking selfies. You seriously 
do not want to read the comments in the 
Daily Express after the site ran a story 
under a photo of smiling Syrian refugees 
with phones on selfie sticks. This particular 
tweet, showing a woman taking a selfie 
when she reaches land, is doing the rounds 
of 
anti-immigrant 
websites, 
and 
is 
considered proof that these are rich people, 
"economic migrants" rather than real 
victims of tragedy.  
 
Personally, I think the first thing I would do 
if I got off an inflatable dinghy after a long 
trip like that is take a selfie of myself and 
my kid to prove that I'd made it. I suspect 
that the happy Syrians are doing much the 
same thing. In fact, according to Middle 
East Online, many migrants consider their 
smartphones to be more important than 
food. " Our phones and power banks are 
more important for our journey than 
anything, even more important than food," 
said 
Wael, 
a 
32-year-old 
from 
the 
devastated Syrian city Homs who reached 
the Greek resort island of Kos on Thursday 
morning.  
21. Which of the above statements would most 
weaken 
the 
author's 
argument 
as 
presented in the final paragraph of the 
passage: " I suspect that the happy Syrians 
are doing much the same thing. "? 
 
A. It was found that for refugees, taking 
selfies and posting them on the internet 
was the only way of telling their families 
back home that they have made it 
across the borders. 
 
B. Research done on earlier instances of 
the mass migrations of the past have 
proved that the first instinct of a refugee 
on reaching his destination is the hunt 
for a suitable shelter, with little regard 
for exhaustion and communication with 
leftovers back home. 
 
C. Migrants are motivated by the love of 
travel and seeking new places rather 
than food and shelter. 
 
D. A profile study done upon the latest 
batch of migrants reaching the shores of 
Europe prove that most of them are 
erstwhile 
businessmen, 
small 
time 
industrialists and traders who are 
looking to set up shop in European 
countries. 
 
E. Middle Eastern immigrants are more 
concerned with the safety of their 
cellphone devices than with arranging 
food and shelter.  
22. Which of the above statements strengthens 
the author's argument " I suspect that the 
happy Syrians are doing much the same 
thing. "

countries. 
 
E. Middle Eastern immigrants are more

cellphone devices than with arranging 
food and shelter.  
23. Which of the above statements can be 
safely inferred from the passage? 
 
A.  It was found that for refugees, taking 
selfies and posting them on the internet 
was the only way of telling their families 
back home that they have made it 
across the borders.
