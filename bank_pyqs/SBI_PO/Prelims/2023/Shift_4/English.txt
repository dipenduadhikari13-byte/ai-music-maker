Q1. Why has cyber security evolved to be the prime priority for an organisation? 
Read the passage to answer the following questions. 
As enterprises, the government and public moving towards digitalization, cybersecurity has become pivotal to 
their basic functioning nowadays. Cyberattacks have been on the rise over the past 12-18 months, affecting 
businesses of all nature and sizes, where the safety of the data network is essential to their operations. As a 
result, cybersecurity has come to occupy a prime position in a company’s list of governance priorities. As more 
companies shifted to work from home, there were database breaches and hackings, leading to loss of revenue 
opportunity across industries. Even systems believed to be highly secure could be breached in cyberattacks. 
Reports say almost 26,000 Indian websites were hacked in the 10-month period ended October. The hackers 
had been operating from different parts of the world with hidden identities. 
While weak passwords are the common cause for such attacks, systems with unprotected or unchanged 
passwords are highly vulnerable. Second, different types of malwares in many cases hidden in another type of 
document only waiting to be executed by the target user. Third, working in unsecured environments such as a 
common Wi-Fi network to access private emails and USB drives may prove risky. The onus is on the 
organisation to take steps to prevent and counter potential threats. They should educate their employees to 
create strong passwords, follow proper protocols in keeping passwords secure. Also, an organisation should 
regularly ensure that its firewalls are capable to resist any malware attack, by installing regular software 
updates. This is also why virtual private networks are being insisted upon in organisations. 
Internal threats could be a result of employee negligence or ignorance, while external threats could be from 
former employees, competitors, and hackers who steal corporate data and money through spoofing and 
phishing. These would obviously lead to reputational damage, financial loss, litigation, regulatory probes, and 
above all, loss of clients and thereby revenue. Ransomware attacks continue to evolve in the market, with the 
past 8-10 months witnessing the highest number of threats of sensitive data exposure. A leading social network 
platform suffered a data breach, wherein millions of profiles containing email addresses, names, dates of birth, 
and phone numbers were sold on the dark Web. 
There are cyber insurance solutions available in the market to protect against losses caused by cyberattacks, 
including first-party and third-party losses, and cyber extortion. 
First-party insurance covers loss caused due to electronic theft, loss of electronic communication, e-vandalism, 
business interruption (income loss due to fraudulent access causing impairment of operations), and the like. 
Third-party loss covers disclosure liability (any customer claims due to system security failures resulting in 
unauthorized access), content liability (for alleged copyright infringement). Cyber extortion occurs when 
cybercriminals threaten to disable the operations of a target business or compromise its confidential data 
unless they receive a payment. Companies usually get cyber insurance solution to eliminate the risk, without 
willingly. Cyber insurance helps cover legal expenses ___________________ from damages due to a cyberattack. It 
should be part of the company’s overall business continuity strategy, as it helps quickly recover post an 
incident. 
(a) Cyber security plays a pivotal role in those organisations where reliability of the data is prerequisite. 
(b) With organizations’ continuous reliance on computerization, cybersecurity has taken the front row seat 
even for governing the day-to-day operations. 
(c) The potential data theft that resulted from the organizational shift, i.e., to work from home culture, could put 
the organisation at monetary risk. 
(d) Only (a) and (b) 
(e) All of these

accessible and highly vulnerable.

end user.

unauthorized access), content liability (for alleged copyright infringement). Cyber extortion occurs when 
cybercriminals threaten to disable the operations of a target business or compromise its confidential data 
unless they receive a payment. Companies usually get cyber insurance solution to eliminate the risk, without

should be part of the company’s overall business continuity strategy, as it helps quickly recover post an 
incident.
