Directions (13-21): Read the following passage and answer the given questions. 
With the United States recently lifting its ban on online betting, the digital gambling landscape has 
experienced a significant paradigm shift, redefining the intersection between technology and wagering. 
Once constrained by stringent regulations, platforms facilitating poker, online casinos, and sports 
betting are now flourishing, attracting an influx of new participants, particularly among the youth. This 
legislative reversal has catalyzed a global ripple effect, influencing betting dynamics in Europe and 
beyond. In response to this shift, several companies are launching innovative gambling platforms to 
capitalize on the growing demand. 
Unlike traditional casinos, which rely on physical establishments, online betting platforms leverage 
advanced digital algorithms, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology to ensure seamless 
transactions and enhanced security. The immediacy of placing wagers from mobile applications, 
coupled with the gamification of betting interfaces, has rendered the experience far more engaging than 
conventional casino gambling. Furthermore, the integration of live-streaming services within sports 
betting platforms has heightened real-time interaction, thereby allowing users to engage with the 
experience in ways never seen before. 
One of the most pronounced impacts of this digital transition is the surge in sports engagement. With 
online betting becoming more accessible, the younger demographic is demonstrating a heightened 
interest in various athletic competitions, including football, basketball, and eSports. Europe, a 
longstanding hub for both regulated gambling and sports culture, has particularly benefited from this 
trend. Increased viewership and participation in sporting events, coupled with a surge in revenue 
streams for clubs and leagues, have fortified the economic structure of professional athletics. Moreover, 
the adoption of responsible gambling initiatives across European jurisdictions has helped mitigate some 
of the potential downsides of digital wagering. 
 
 
However, despite these apparent advantages, the rapid expansion of online betting carries inherent 
risks. The accessibility and anonymity afforded by digital gambling platforms can foster addictive 
behaviors, particularly among impressionable youth. A lack of financial literacy among new bettors 
exacerbates the potential for substantial monetary losses, while the gamified nature of online casinos 
may obscure the psychological toll of compulsive gambling. If left unchecked, what was once a 
recreational activity can quickly devolve into a destructive vice, draining financial resources and leading 
to social isolation. Additionally, concerns surrounding data privacy, fraudulent schemes, and 
unregulated markets persist, raising ethical questions about the long-term sustainability of online 
betting. 
As the online gambling industry continues to evolve, striking a balance between economic benefits and 
responsible gaming policies will be paramount. Without adequate safeguards, the societal costs of 
unchecked digital betting could outweigh its economic and recreational merits.
