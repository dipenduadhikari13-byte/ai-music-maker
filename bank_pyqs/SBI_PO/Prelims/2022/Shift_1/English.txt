1. Directions: Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow by
choosing the correct/most appropriate options:
The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer
day; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green. The people
of the village began to gather in the square, between the post office and the bank,
around ten o'clock; in some towns, there were so many people that the lottery took two
days and had to be started on June 27th but in this village, where there were only
about three hundred people, the whole lottery took less than two hours, so it could
begin at ten o'clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to
get home for noon dinner. The children assembled first, of course. The school was
recently over for the summer, and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them;
they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous
play and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands.
Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon
followed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry
Jones and Dickie Delacroix-- the villagers pronounced this name "Dellacroy"--
eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it
against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside, talking among themselves,
looking over their shoulders at rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older
brothers or sisters.
Soon the men began to gather surveying their own children, speaking of planting and
rain, tractors, and taxes. They stood together, away _______ the pile of stones in the
corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women,
wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They
greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands.
Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the
children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked
under his mother's grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His
father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his
father and his oldest brother. The lottery was conducted--as were the square dances,
the teen club, and the Halloween program--by Mr. Summers who had time and energy
to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal
business, and people were sorry for him because he had no children and his wife was
a scold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a
murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called "Little late
today, folks." The postmaster, Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three-legged stool,
(+1, -0.25)
and the stool was put in the center of the square and Mr. Summers set the black box
down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves and
the stool and when Mr. Summers said, "Some of you fellows want to give me a hand?"
there was a hesitation before two men. Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter came
forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers
inside it.

lottery took two days and had to be started on June 27th but in this village, where
there were only about three hundred people, the whole lottery took less than two
hours, so it could begin at ten o'clock in the morning and still be through in time to
allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner. The children assembled first, of
course. The school was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of liberty sat
uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before
they broke into boisterous play and their talk was still of the classroom and the
teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full
of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the smoothest and
roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix-- the villagers
pronounced this name "Dellacroy"--eventually made a great pile of stones in one
corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls
stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at rolled in the
dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.
Soon the men began to gather surveying their own children, speaking of planting and
rain, tractors, and taxes. They stood together, away _______ the pile of stones in the
corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women,
wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They
greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their
husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their
children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times.
Bobby Martin ducked under his mother's grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to
the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his
place between his father and his oldest brother. The lottery was conducted--as were
the square dances, the teen club, and the Halloween program--by Mr. Summers who
had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man
(+1, -0.25)
and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him because he had no
children and his wife was a scold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black
wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved
and called "Little late today, folks." The postmaster, Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying
a three-legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the square and Mr.
Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a
space between themselves and the stool and when Mr. Summers said, "Some of you
fellows want to give me a hand?" there was a hesitation before two men. Mr. Martin
and his oldest son, Baxter came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr.
Summers stirred up the papers inside it.
