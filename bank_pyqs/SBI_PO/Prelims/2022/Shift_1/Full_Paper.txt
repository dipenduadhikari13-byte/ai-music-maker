100 Questions
Que. 1
Directions: Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow by choosing the
correct/most appropriate options: 
The advent of 5G technology has revolutionized connectivity, promising lightning-fast speeds and seamless
communication. However, ensuring its efficacy and reliability within the confines of an airplane presents unique
challenges. This RC aims to explore the feasibility and potential benefits of implementing a robust 5G network
for passenger mobile usage during flights.
In order to achieve a viable solution, stakeholders in the aviation industry must come together to hammer out a
comprehensive plan. Airlines, telecommunication providers, and regulatory bodies need to collaborate closely to
address technical obstacles and guarantee passenger safety. One key aspect is to concede that cellular signals
pose no threat to the aircraft's avionics. Extensive research and stringent testing protocols should be implemented
to alleviate concerns and provide unequivocal evidence.
Another vital element is securing agreements with telecom companies to establish reliable 5G infrastructure that
caters specifically to in-flight usage. These agreements should focus on optimizing network coverage,
minimizing signal interference, and maximizing bandwidth capacity. Additionally, international cooperation and
harmonization of regulations will be crucial to ensure seamless connectivity across different airspace
jurisdictions.
By hammering out the intricate details, all parties involved can agree upon standardized guidelines and
protocols for the use of mobile devices during flights. This will enhance the passenger _______, enabling them
to stay connected and productive throughout their journey while simultaneously respecting safety and security
regulations.
Implementing a 5G network for passenger mobile usage in airplanes requires collective efforts, with stakeholders
conceding potential concerns and agreeing on effective solutions. A seamless and reliable 5G network can be
