Answers
1. Answer: a
Explanation:
The correct answer is ' CABD '.
  Key Points
After going through the sentence we find that:
Part Etalks about retail supermarkets which is not relevant to the context.
So the odd part is E.
The sentence should begin with Cfollowed by Awhich mentions that India is
one of the largest centres for polishing gems and diamonds(as mentioned
in part B).
Clearly, the next part is Bwhich mentions that India is famous for polishing
diamonds and gems.
The concluding part is Dwhich mentions that India is also known as one of
the largest centres for manufacturing jewellery.
Thus, only CABD can make a coherent sentence.
The correct sentence will be :  India is one of the largest centres for polishing
diamonds and gems and manufacturing jewellery .

12. Answer: a
Explanation:
The correct answer is ' A '  i.e.  this part of the sentencehas an error .
  Key Points
In the first part of the given sentence, the  plural form of the verb'do'  is 
incorrect .
The  subject 'Education'  in the given sentence is a  singular subject .
We know that  a singular subject always takes a singular verb .
The  singular form of the verb  ' does ' should be used with the  singular subject  '
Education '.
Therefore, the  singular form of the verb'does'  should be used  in place of  the 
plural form of the verb  ' do '.
Hence, the correct answer is  option 1 .
Correct sentence:Education does not mean teaching people to know what they do
not know; it means teaching them to behave as they do not behave .
  Additional Information
Subjects and verbs must agree with one another in number  (singular or plural).
Thus,  if a subject is singular , its  verb must also be singular ;  if  the  subject is
plural , its  verb must also be plural .
13. Answer: a
Explanation:
The correct answer is ' A 'i.e.this part of the sentencehas an error .
  Key Points
In the first part of the given sentence, the noun ' COVID-19 pandemic 'is
 aspecified noun .
The  definite article  ' the ' is used before singular and plural nouns when
the  noun is specific or particular .
' A' and ' an ' are  indefinite articles , which means that they refer to, or introduce,
an  unspecified noun .
We use ' a' before a  consonant sound  and we use ' an ' before a  vowel
sound .
''No article''  is used when we refer to  general ideas, plurals, or uncountable
nouns .
Therefore, the  definite article 'the'  should be used  in place of  the  indefinite
article 'a' .
Hence, the correct answer is  option 1 .
Correct Sentence: The COVID-19 pandemic is   an ongoing global pandemic  of
coronavirus disease 2019   caused by severe acute  respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
  Additional Information

14. Answer: b
Explanation:
The correct answer is Option (2) i.e. Only B
  Key Points
Replace  SQUARES  with  SQUARE .
' Square ' is an  adjective( a unit ) here while ' squares ' is a  noun( a geometric
figure).
Square as an adjective is used before units of length when  referring to the area
of something. 
Forexample ,  if something is three meters long and two meters wide, its
area is six square meters.
Hence,  option 2  is the correct answer.
The correct sentence is :My father gave me a five hundred  square  feet house from
his property so that I can live a respectful life.
15. Answer: c
Explanation:
The correct answer is '(B)'.
  Key Points
Reading the sentence we find that:
The  adjective order some Mughal silver charmingused in  part B  is incorrect.
The order of cumulative adjectives is as follows: quantity, opinion, size,
temperature, age, color, shape, origin, and material
The sentence can be made correct if we reorder the adjectives in the following
manner -  some charming Mughal silver (  quantity- opinion - age - material)
The correct sentence will be:  I bought some charming Mughal silver ornaments at
the Hauz Khas market and enjoyed visiting the ruins yesterday.
  Additional Information
When a number of adjectives are used together, the order depends on the
function of the adjective. The usual order is:
quantity, value/opinion, size, temperature, age, shape, colour, origin,
material
What the adjective expresses
Examples
Quantity
four, ten, a few, several
Opinion
delicious, charming, beautiful
Size
tall, tiny, huge
Temperature
hot, cold
Age
old, young, new, 14-year-old
Shape
square, round
Colour
red, purple, green
Origin
Swedish, Victorian, Chinese
Material
glass, silver, wooden
For example - I love the  beautiful old big green antique  car that is always
parked at the end of the street. [quality – age – size – color – origin]
16. Answer: b
Explanation:
The correct answer is -must bring their own costume- the error lies in this part only.
  Key Points
In the sentence, the error is in  part C  where the possessive pronoun  their  is
incorrect.
In the sentence, the teacher says that every girl should bring costume to
participate in the competition. There is an emphasis that every girl should bring
own costume.
The usage of their  is inappropriate in this context. ‘Every girl’ being singular
noun, the correct possessive pronoun should be  her  instead of their.
Thus the correct sentence is: The teacher said that every girl in the class must bring 
her  own costumeto participate in the dance competition.
  Additional Information
Possessive pronouns  indicate that something belongs to someone. These are
never spelled with apostrophes. Commonly known possessive pronouns are
my, our, your,his, her, its and their.
There are  independent possessive pronouns ( absolute possessive pronouns)
 namely mine, ours, yours, his, hers, its and theirs, which are used without a
noun. Examples:
My laptop is not working. Please give me yours .
Did you know that dress is mine ?
The car parked on the street is theirs .
17. Answer: c
Explanation:
The correct answer is ‘ call for fisheries to move away from ’.
  Key Points
In the given sentence, the use of ‘ call up ’ in the phrase ‘call up fisheries to
move away from’ is incorrect.
The phrasal verb ‘ call up ’ means ‘ to order or summon together for a duty
’. Considering the given sentence, it can be inferred that the
environmentalists cannot order or summon the fisheries, as they do not have
any such authority. Besides, they are not bringing the fisheries sector together
for any duty. Thus, usage ‘call up’ is inappropriate.
In the context of the sentence, it is most plausible that the environmentalists
urge the fisheries to move away from harmful practices. Therefore, we need to
find a phrasal verb that means ‘ to urge or request’ .  ‘ Call for ’ means ‘to make
a request or demand’ . Thus, the correct answer is  option 3 .
The correct sentence will be: Environmentalists  call for fisheries to move away from
 carbon-spewing engines and climate-harming practices such as bottom trawling.
  Additional Information
‘ Call in ’ means to summon for one’s help or consultation. Example: The officer 
called in the surveyor to oversee the implementation work. 
‘ Call at ’ means to stop at a place briefly. It is used while referring to a ship or a
boat. Example: The ship called at the port for an hour.
18. Answer: c
Explanation:
The correct answer is ‘has been filmed chasing and eating ’.
  Key Points
In the given sentence, the verb form ‘ chase ’ used in the phrase ‘has been
filmed to chase and eating’ is incorrect.
The sentence talks about a Seychelles giant tortoise that was thought to be a
strict herbivore. Considering the sentence, ‘has been filmed to chase and
eating’ is incorrect as per the parallel structure/ parallelism rule.  While ‘ eating ’
reflects present continuous tense, ‘ to chase ’ indicates ‘infinitive’. Thus, there is
distortion in the parallel structure. 
The correct verb form should be in the present continuous tense . Hence, 
‘chasing’  is correct.
Options 1 consists of incorrect verb form, so it is incorrect. Options 2 and
4 mention ‘have’, which is plural and thus incorrect while talking about a
tortoise( singular noun).
Therefore, the correct answer is  option 3 . 
The correct sentence will be: A  Seychelles  giant tortoise, a species previously
thought to be a strict herbivore,  has been filmed chasing and eating  a baby bird in
a 'horrifying and amazing' attack, with researchers stating it was the first
documented example of deliberate hunting in the wild by the species.
  Additional Information
Parallelism, also referred to as parallel structure or parallel construction, is a
grammatical balance within a sentence. It is the matching of the forms of
words, phrases, or clauses in a sentence.
19. Answer: b
Explanation:
The correct answer is a million rupees is.
  Key Points
Whenever adjectives such as much, less, little and more are used as nouns,
they are always followed by a singular verb.
Ex : a thousand rupees is required to take the ride.
Also, the sentence is in the present form, hence, option 3 is eliminated.
So, Option 2 is the only correct answer.
The correct sentence is:  Amount of less than a million rupees is required right now.
Take the money to the bank and withdraw it.
  Additional Information
Countable and Uncountable nouns:
Nouns can be countable or uncountable . Countable nouns can be counted,
e.g. an apple, two apples, three apples, etc. Uncountable nouns cannot be
counted, e.g. air, rice, water, etc. 
For positive sentences, we can use a/an for singular nouns or some for plurals.
There's aman at the door.  I have some friends in New York.
For negatives, we can use a/an for singular nouns or any for plurals.
I don't have adog.  There aren't any seats.
We use ' some ' with uncountable nouns in positive sentences and ' any ' with
negatives.
There's some milk in the fridge.  There isn't any coffee
20. Answer: c
Explanation:
The correct answer is Utmost .
  Key Points
Significant : Important in effect or meaning
"a significant change in tax laws"
Utmost : Of the greatest possible degree, extent or intensity
"utmost contempt"
Hence, the word ' significant ' should be replaced with ' utmost ' to form a
contextually correct sentence.
It should read as:  
The firm continues to place  utmost  significance on regulatory compliance and
strives to fulfil supervisory standards, according to a press statement.
  Additional Information
Let us understand the meaning of the other options:
Finicky : Exacting especially about details
Initiate : Take the lead or initiative in
Partial : Being or affecting only a part; not total
Subsequent : Following in time or order
21. Answer: a
Explanation:
The correct answer is option 1, i.e. ‘impertinent’  meaning‘not showing proper respect;
rude.'
From the sentence, it is very clear that the speaker is trying to highlight Shriya’s
irrelevant manner that outside she behaved respectfully but inside she shut the
speaker in the most barefaced way, hence, judicious does not make sense.
The meaning of the other words-
Persistent : continuing firmly or obstinately in an opinion or course of action in
spite of difficulty or opposition
Relevant : closely connected or appropriate to what is being done or
considered
Permanent : lasting or intended to last or remain unchanged indefinitely
22. Answer: b
Explanation:
The correct answer is option 2 i.e. "fifty percentage of the quota"
  Key Points
The passage states that "Access will be consistent with the actual balance of
payments needs, capped at 50 percent of the quota, and will be added to the
current annual access limits under the RCF/RFI."
So, we can say that  the highest limit on the actual balance of payments needs
is capped at 50 percent of the quota.
Hence, the correct answer is fifty percentage of the quota.
23. Answer: c
Explanation:
The correct answer is option 3 i.e "driving up"
  Key Points
Drive up:
Grammatical class: phrasal verb.
Meaning: Increase in value, price or amount of something.
Example: The on going famine is driving up the inflation.
Hence, the correct answer is driving up.
24. Answer: a
Explanation:
The correct answer is option 1 i.e only II and III.
  Key Points
Acute:
Meaning: Extreme, severe or becoming dangerous
Synonyms: Grave, profound, excruciating
Antonym: Mild.
"I) She is doing this work since the last two years hence she can do it acute." 
This sentence doesn't make any sense.
"II) His grand father is suffering from an acute disease."
Which means his grandfather is suffering from a serious illness.
"III) There is an acute connection between political instability and civil war."
Which means there is a strong relationship between political instability
and civil war.
Hence, only sentence II and III are correct.
25. Answer: b
Explanation:
The correct answer is option 2 i.e "International Monetary Fund"
  Key Points
The full form of IMF is given in the very first line of the passage.
"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive Board approved on
September 30 a new, temporary Food Shock Window (FSW) under its
emergency financing instruments."
26. Answer: c
Explanation:
The correct answer is option 3 i.e. "Countries are allowed to monitor the programe if
they fulfil some criteria"
  Key Points
According to the context of the passage option 3 is correct.
The passage states that,
"The Executive Board also amended the policy for Staff-Monitored
Programs (SMPs), to allow for Program Monitoring with Board involvement
(PMB)."
" Countries considering an SMP would be encouraged to request a PMB if
they are the subject of an ongoing concerted international effort by
creditors or donors to provide substantial new financing or debt relief, or
have significant outstanding Fund credit under emergency financing
instruments."
Hence, option 3 can be inferred from the passage.
27. Answer: d
Explanation:
The correct answer is option 4 i,e. "Any country in the world which is suffering from
food shortage can avail the assistance"
  Key Points
According to the passage the criteria for availing the financial assistant are:
"The Food Shock Window will provide, for a period of a year, a new channel
for emergency Fund financing to member countries that have an urgent
balance of payment needs "
The country should be a member IMF
The country must have  an urgent balance of payment needs due to:
1. acute food insecurity, or
2. a sharp increase in their food import bill, or
3. a shock to their cereal exports.
Hence, option 4 is incorrect.
28. Answer: b
Explanation:
The correct answer is option 2 i.e. "The IMF will consider the transactions between
the country and rest of the world before giving any financial assistance ."
  Key Points
It is given that "Access will be consistent with the actual balance of payments
needs, capped at 50 percent of the quota"
Short definition of Balance of payment is record of transactions of a
country during specific period.
Hence, "the IMF will consider thetransactions between the country and rest of
the world before giving any financial assistance"is the correct answer.
  Additional Information
Option 1:"The Financial aid will be provided according to the demand of the
countries."
This option is incorrect because it is given that the criteria to decide
amount of the assist is the balance of payment.
Option 3:"The access to the financial assistance will be fix in value even for
future"
This option is incorrect because it is given that "The cumulative access
limits under the RFI regular window and the RCF exogenous shock window,
currently at 150 percent of quota, will be increased to 175 percent of quota
for members that will borrow through the FSW."
Option 4:"The Financial assistance program will be a responsibility of the
executive board only"
This option is incorrect because it is given that "The Executive Board’s role
will be limited to assessing the robustness of the member’s policies to
meet the program’s objectives and to monitoring program
implementation, including policies aiming to facilitate the transition to an
upper credit tranche (UCT) quality IMF-supported program."
Option 5:"The food stock window will help the affected countries till the supply
chain get normalize."
This option is incorrect because it is given that  " The Food Shock Window
will provide, for a period of a year, a new channel for emergency Fund
financing to member countries that have an urgent balance of payment
needs due to acute food insecurity, a sharp increase in their food import
bill, or a shock to their cereal exports."

41. Answer: a
Explanation:
Given:
Time taken to complete a work by A = 60 days
B is 25% more efficient than A
(A + B) worked together = 15 days
Time taken to complete the remaining work by C = 14 days
Formula used:
Work = Efficiency × Time
Calculation:
Let the efficiency of A be x
B is 25% more efficient than A
⇒ (25/100)x = 1x/4
Efficient of A = 4
Efficient of B = (4 + 1) = 5
Total work = (4 × 60) = 240 units
A and B worked together for 15 days = [(5 + 4) × 15]
⇒ (9 × 15) = 135 units
Remaining work = (240 – 135) = 105 units
Time taken to complete the remaining work by C = (105/14) 
⇒ 15/2 = 7.5
Time taken by B and C to complete the 5/8th part of original work = [240/(5 +
7.5) × 5/8]
⇒ (240/12.5 × 5/8)
⇒ (6 × 2)
⇒ 12 days
∴ The required time is 12 days
  Shortcut Trick
So, total efficiency of A and B = 9
In 15 days work of A + B = 9 × 15 = 135 units
Remaining (240 - 135) = 105 units will complete by C in 14 days
So, C in one day = 7.5 units
Time taken by B and C to complete the 5/8 th  part of original work = [240/(5 +
7.5) × 5/8] = 12 days

43. Answer: d
Explanation:
Given:
Total deposit = Rs. 16500
R 1= 10%
R 2= 12%
Time = 2 years 
Total interest = Rs. 3620
Concept Used:
SI = PRT/100
Calculation:
Suppose,
Rs. x is deposited at 10% 
Rs. (16500 – x) at 12%
​ =
48
144
x
As we know,
⇒ SI = PRT/100
According to the question
(x × 10 × 2)/100 + [(16500 – x) × 12 × 2]/100 = 3620
⇒ 20x/100 + (396000 – 24x)/100 = 3620
⇒ 20x + 396000 – 24x = 362000
⇒ 24x – 20x = 396000 – 362000
⇒ 4x = 34000
⇒ x = 34000/4
⇒ x = Rs. 8500
∴ Amount invested at 12% = 16500 – 8500 = Rs. 8000
  Shortcut Trick
⇒ SI for 2 years = 3620
⇒ SI for 1 year = 3620/2 = 1810
Let Rs. x be invested at 12%
⇒ 10% of 16500
⇒ 1650
2% of x = 1810 – 1650
⇒ x × 2/100 = 160
∴ x = Rs. 8000

sq. cm.
Area of right angle triangle
The perimeter of the rectangle is 84 cm.

45. Answer: d
Explanation:
Given:

Mixture B has 25 liters of water.
=
​bh =

168
b =
​ =
12
168
14 cm
Calculation:
Water in mixture A = 250/(4+1) × 4
⇒ 200 liters 
And milk in mixture A = 250/(4+1) × 1
⇒  50 liters
Milk in mixture B = 25/5 ×  7
⇒   35 liters
Now 40% of mixture A is taken to make mixture C 
So milk taken from mixture A to make mixture C = 50  ×  40/100
⇒  20 liters
And water taken from mixture A to make mixture C = 200 × 40/100
⇒  80 liters
80% of mixture B is taken to make mixture C
So Milk taken from mixture B to make mixture C = 35  × 80/100
⇒  28 liters
And water taken from mixture B to make mixture C = 25  × 80/100
⇒   20 liters
In mixture C
Total milk = (M ilk taken from mixture A + Milk taken from mixture B) 
⇒  20 + 28 = 48 liters
Total water =  (Water  taken from mixture A + Water taken from mixture B )
⇒ 80 + 20
⇒  100 liters
The ratio of Milk to Water in mixture C = 48:100
⇒  12:25

Arvind gives 50% of his money to  his son and  30% to his wife = 50% + 30%
⇒ 80% of the total money
So remaining money = 100x - (80/100 × 100x)
⇒ 20x
Now donations to trust =  20x × 62.5/100 
⇒ 12.5x 
H e is left with 15,000 Rs.
So 15000 Rs. = 20x - 12.5x 
⇒ 15000  Rs. = 7.5x
⇒ x = 2000  Rs.
So total money at beginning = 100 × 2000
⇒  2,00,000 Rs
58. Answer: b
Explanation:
⇒ Assume, that Bikash joined after x months.
⇒ Profit is divided in the ratio of the product of capital invested and the time for
which it is invested.
⇒ Product of investment and time for Ashay = 24000 × 12
⇒ Product of investment and time for Bikash = 18000 × (12 – x)
⇒ (216000 – 18000x)/288000 = 7/16
⇒ (216 – 18x)/288 = 7/16
⇒ 3456 – 288x = 2016
⇒ x = 5
59. Answer: d
Explanation:
Given:
Two pipes can fill a tank in 12 hours and 15 hours respectively
while the third pipes can empty it in 18 hours
Formula used:
Work = Efficiency × Time
Calculation:
Total Capacity of the tank = LCM( 12 , 15 , 18)
= 180
Efficiency of First pipe = 180/12
= 15
Efficiency of Second pipe = 180/15
= 12
Efficiency of Third pipe = 180/18
= 10
Capacity of the tank after two pipes filled the tank for 5 hours = ( Efficiency of First
pipe + Efficiency of Second pipe) × 5
= 27  × 5
= 135
Time taken to empty the tank filled by two pipes for 5 hours = 135/Efficiency of Third
 pipe
= 135/10
= 13.5  hours
Answer is 13.5 hours.
60. Answer: a
Explanation:
Given:
A train covers total distance = 400km
Formula Used:
Speed = Distance covered/Time taken
Calculation:
Let the speed of the train be x
Time taken by train = 400/x
Now, the increased speed of train be(x + 10)
Now, Time taken by train = 400/(x + 10)
According to the question;
Difference between time taken = 2 hours
⇒ 400/x - 400/(x + 10) = 2
⇒ 1/x - 1/(x + 10) = 2/400
⇒ 10 × 200 = x 2  + 10x
⇒ x 2 + 10x = 2000
⇒ x 2 + 10x - 2000 = 0
⇒ x = - 50, 40
The speed of the train = 40 km/hr
Time taken by train = 400/40 = 10 hours
∴ The usual time taken by the train to complete the journey is 10 hours .

71. Answer: a
Explanation:
Given Statements : F = S ≥ G < V, Q > P ≥ X, F  ≥ X, V ≤ M
On combining :   Q > P ≥  X ≤ F = S ≥ G < V ≤ M
I. M > G → True ( As M ≥ V > G is definitely true, Hence M > G is true )
II. S < Q →  False ( As Q > P ≥  X ≤ F = S,  So there is no direct relation between S and Q,
Hence S < Q will be false.)
Hence, Only conclusion I follow.
72. Answer: d
Explanation:
Given statements : P > Q < R, R = S ≥ T, T ≤  U > V
On combining :  P > Q < R = S ≥ T ≤ U > V
(I) S > P → False (as S = R > Q < P there is no direct relation given between the two, it
might be a possibility but not definitely true, Hence false )
(II) U > R →  False (as U ≥ T ≤ S = R there is no direct relation given between the two, it
might be a possibility but not definitely true, Hence false ).
Hence, Neither I nor  II follows.
73. Answer: a
Explanation:
Given statements:   T > N < V = L ≤ W < K, V = H > I > F
On combining :     T > N < V = L ≤ W < K,    T > N < V = H > I > F
I. V > F → True ( As V  = H > I > F so V > F is true )
II. T > H →  False ( As  T > N < V  = H > I > F no direct relation is given between the two,
so it is possibility but not definitely true Hence T > H is false)
Hence, Only I follow.

Explanation:
Given statement:
'for the victory sign' is coded as 'si vi th fo',
‘empty the apartment now’ is coded as ‘no ap th em’
‘now for the finale’ is coded as ‘fi th fo no’
‘for empty sign victory’ is coded as ‘vi si em fo’
We get:
for - fo
the - th
empty - em

The codes for ‘apartment’ and ‘finale’ is determined by elimination, i.e. all the other
codes in the sentence are determined:
apartment - ap
finale – fi
We can not clearly determine the codes for ‘victory’ and ‘sign’:
victory – vi/si
sign – si/vi
Hence, the code for 'Now' is no.

Explanation:
Given words: PROPELLER
1 st , 3 rd , 6 th , and 8 th letter of the word PROPELLER is: P, O, L, and E
Combining and un-jumbling the letters we get: POLE and LOPE
Since 2 words are possible from the letters.
Hence, the answer is Y.
86. Answer: b
Explanation:
The pattern for the code is as follows,
As per the English Alphabetical Series,
Z - 2 = X; X - 2 = V
D - 2 = B; B - 2 = Z
G + 2 = I; I + 2 = K
F - 2 = D; D - 2 = B
K - 2 = I; I - 2 = G
Hence, 'GIK' is the odd one out.

Explanation:
Given:
5 designations - CEO, CFO, Manager, Clerk, and Peon
CEO is the senior most and Peon is the juniormost person. 
They have a different number of pens such that no two persons have the same
number of pens.
Now,
1) Two persons are junior to Z. It means Z is a Manager.
2) The one who is just senior to the one who is Manager has 33 pens. It means CFO
has 33 pens.
3) One designation lies between the one who has 33 pens and A. It means A is Clerk.

1) Two persons are junior to Z. It means Z is a Manager.
2) The one who is just senior to the one who is Manager has 33 pens. It means CFO
has 33 pens.
3) One designation lies between the one who has 33 pens and A. It means A is Clerk.

6) A has 11 pens more and 9 pens more than W and Q respectively. It means A =
W+11 and A = Q+9. W+11 = Q+9. Q-W = 2. Q has more pens than W. In case I, Q has 45
pens and W has 33 pens. But 45-33 is not equal to 2. So, the case I get eliminated. In
case II, again there are two possibilities:
Possibility I -  W have 33 pens. So Q will have 35 pens and A will have 44 pens.
Possibility II -  Q has 33 pens so W will have 31 pens and A will have 42 pens.

7) The difference in the number of pens between R and Z is 14 and Z has the least
number of pens. So, R – 14 = Z. Z has 45-14 =31 pens. But no two persons can have
the same number of pens. So, case II (b) gets eliminated as W also has 31 pens in it.

91. Answer: b
Explanation:
Given:
5 designations - CEO, CFO, Manager, Clerk, and Peon
CEO is the senior most and Peon is the juniormost person. 
They have a different number of pens such that no two persons have the same
number of pens.
Now,
1) Two persons are junior to Z. It means Z is a Manager.
2) The one who is just senior to the one who is Manager has 33 pens. It means CFO
has 33 pens.
3) One designation lies between the one who has 33 pens and A. It means A is Clerk.

Explanation:
Detailed solution will be provided soon.
Given 9 member in a family- F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M and N.
Three generations, two married couples. There is no single parent in the family. 
1) N is the daughter of F who has two children. F is the sister-in-law of I. N has a son.
So, F and N both are married. Because there is no single parent in the family.
2) J is the son of K and J doesn’t have a sister.
3) M is the only brother-in-law of J’s grandfather. G belongs to the first generation
of the family. Also, L is G’s child. So, G is married. G is the grandfather of J and M is
the only brother of F.
4) H is the only brother-in-law of N.
Gender of L  is not known.
Hence, relation between L and  maternal uncle of N cannot be determined.

Three generations, two married couples. There is no single parent in the family. 
1) N is the daughter of F who has two children. F is the sister-in-law of I. N has a son.
So, F and N both are married. Because there is no single parent in the family.
2) J is the son of K and J doesn’t have a sister.
3) M is the only brother-in-law of J’s grandfather. G belongs to the first generation
of the family. Also, L is G’s child. So, G is married. G is the grandfather of J and M is
the only brother of F.
4) H is the only brother-in-law of N.
If G does not have a brother, then I is the sister of G.
Hence, I is the paternal aunt of H's sister-in-law N.
95. Answer: d
Explanation:
Detailed solution will be provided soon.
Given 9 member in a family- F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M and N.
Three generations, two married couples. There is no single parent in the family. 
1) N is the daughter of F who has two children. F is the sister-in-law of I. N has a son.
So, F and N both are married. Because there is no single parent in the family.
2) J is the son of K and J doesn’t have a sister.
3) M is the only brother-in-law of J’s grandfather. G belongs to the first generation
of the family. Also, L is G’s child. So, G is married. G is the grandfather of J and M is
the only brother of F.
4) H is the only brother-in-law of N.
If L is the daughter of G, we still can't find the gender of I.
Hence, number of male members cannot be determined.
