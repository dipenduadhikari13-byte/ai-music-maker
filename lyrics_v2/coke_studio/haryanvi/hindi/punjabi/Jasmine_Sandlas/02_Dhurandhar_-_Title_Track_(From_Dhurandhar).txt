 Ladies and gentlemen
 You are not ready for this
 Na de dil pardesi nu
 Tainu nit da rona pai jau ga
 Na de dil pardesi nu
 Tainu nit da rona pai jau ga
 Naal raanjhe te jogI de
 Tainu jogan hona pai jau ga
 Main ishq de alleya zakhmaan de
 Khud hass hass ke muh seen langi
 Je yaar mera mainu zehar zehar zehar zehar
 Get ready
 Dhurandhar
 I'm a king
 But I'm far from a saint
 They call me a bad man
 That's a fu..... good thing
 Mama said swing back
 When another man swings
 So I make my mama proud
 And I make the hits rain
 Father forgive me
 I can't forgive them
 You know my history
 You know what I did then
 What I do now
 A whole lot worse
 Heavy is the head
 It's a blessing and a curse
 Na de dil pardesi nu
 Tainu nit da rona pai jau ga
 Naal raanjhe te jogI de
 Tainu jogan hona pai jau ga
 Main ishq de alleya zakhmaan de
 Khud hass hass ke muh seen langi
 Je yaar mera mainu zehar zehar zehar zehar
 Dhurandhar
 Dhurandhar
 Na de dil pardesi nu
 Tainu nit da rona pai jau ga
 Naal raanjhe te jogI de
 Tainu jogan hona pai jau ga
 Main ishq de alleya zakhmaan de
 Khud hass hass ke muh seen langi
 Je yaar mera mainu zehar zehar zehar zehar
 Dhurandhar
 Dhurandhar
 Na de dil
 Na de dil
 Na de
 Na de
 Turn it up
 One and only
 Callin' out all the phonies
 Goat of 'em all
 Dhurandhar
 He's invincible
 He's untouchable
 He's seen it all
 Dhurandhar
 One and only
 Callin' out all the phonies
 Goat of 'em all
 Dhurandhar
 He's invincible
 He's untouchable
 He's seen it all
 I'm a king
 But I'm far from a saint
 They call me a bad man
 That's a good good thing
 Mama said swing back
 When another man swings
 So I make my mama proud
 And I make the hits rain
 Heavy is the head
 Heavy is the head
 Heavy is the head
 It's a blessing and a curse
 Heavy is the head
 Heavy is the head
 Heavy is the head
 Im'ma make it worse
 Heavy is the head
 Heavy is the head
 Heavy is the head
 Hit 'em where it hurts
 Dhurandhar
