Title:  NEVER LET YOU GO
Artist: AP Dhillon
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

I'm all in my feelings
Nightmares that I'm dreamin'
Right where you lost me
And now you don't want me, no
I was smokin' and drinkin'
Anything to stop thinkin'
My house feels empty
My heart feels too heavy, no

'Cause I, I wanna hold you
Like I never held you
Oh, when I do, I'll never let you go
Well, I wanna love you
Like I never left you
And when I do, I'll never let you go
Let you go
Let you go
Let you go

I wish you could just walk in
Hit me up without a warnin'
Where are you tonight? 'Cause I'm losin' my mind, oh
I should've told you what you meant to me
I should've given you my everything and never let you leave
Oh, what I'd do just to change the fact
That you are not here and you can't come back now

I, I wanna hold you
Like I never held you
Oh, when I do, I'll never let you go
Well, I wanna love you
Like I never left you
And when I do, I'll never let you go
Let you go
Let you go
Let you go

I don't wanna feel this anymore
I don't wanna be this anymore
Take me there
Take me there
I don't wanna wake up on my own
You're the only thing I've ever known
Take me there
Take me there

'Cause I, I wanna hold you
Like I never held you
Oh, when I do, I'll never let you go
Well, I wanna love you
Like I never left you
And when I do,
I'll never let you go (Oh, when I do, I'll never let you)
I'll never let you go (Let you go)
I'll never (Let you go)
I'll never (Let you go)
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go (Let you go)
I'll never (Let you go)
I'll never, yeah, yeah (Let you go)
The End
