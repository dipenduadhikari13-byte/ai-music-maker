Title:  Levels

I was gonna rip his heart out, I'm the best ever
I'm the most brutal and vicious
And most ruthless champion there's ever been
There's no one can stop me
Lennox is a conqueror? No, I'm Alexander, he's no Alexander

I'm the best ever
There's never been anybody as ruthless
I'm Sonny Liston, I'm Jack Dempsey
There's no one like-, I'm from their cloth
There's no one that can match me
My style is impetuous, my defense is impregnable

Oh, broke as fuck ne, haan diye
Lifetime di pension mangde ne (yeah)
Maadi janaani wangu ni
Saale maithon attention mangde ne

Bina gallon vich auna chaunde
Saade rival de nahi, haan diye

Tu jinnhaan naa' compare kare
Saade level de nahi, haan diye
Jinnhaan naa' compare kare
Saade level de nahi, haan diye

Levels to this shit
There's levels to this shit
And then I bought my whip
There's levels to this shit

Aithey kehda kinne joga ae
Sab jaat jaanda chhakeyan di
Kujh Majhe de jatt bande aan
Kujh copy bande yakkeyan di

Oh bhull jaande, par kujh nahi muhre
Devil de ni, haan diye

Tu jinnhaan naa' compare kare
Saade level de nahi, haan diye
Jinnhaan naa' compare kare
Saade level de nahi, haan diye

Levels to this shit
There's levels to this shit
And then I bought my whip
There's levels to this shit

Yo, it's like who else you really know that be settin' the bar
They just dropped a couple songs, but they think they're star
We don't run from competition, we don't run from the law
If you tryna level up, I'm the one that you call

I just do this for the love, I don't do this for the bag
They said meet me at the top, I looked around like "Where y'all at?"
Pardon if i left, fuck you if you mad
I could lose everything, it's still double what you had

It's like they watching all my move and they copying my style
They say they really ain't, but I know they in denial
We sittin' at the top, and I know it's been a while (yeah)
Hmm, I know it's been a while

Oh, pith utte taan bahut bolde, muh 'te kehno sangde ne
Main roti paaya jinnhaan nu, ajj verse de paise mangde ne
Oh, saanu maada-changa bol ke beef chala laye kaiyaan ne
Jatt diyan vaddiyan laa ke photo'an geet chala laye kaiyaan ne

Leeliyan, feeliyan, chintu, candy peher-peher 'te vikhde ne
Nitt navaan koi khasam ne karde, ikk 'te kitthey tikde ne
Oh, saade baare hi shit talk'an te saade kolon hi sikhde ne
Ajj vi je koi pyo puchhda taan naa Sidhu da puchhde ne

Oh, paid collab'an karke chobar karda nahiyo chaud, kude
Solo-dolo move kare te bande dekh record, kude
No Name te brand value dassan di koi lod nahi
Aathne EP chhadi si te tadke si Billboard, kude
(Tadke si Billboard, kude, tadke si Billboard, kude)

Ho, nahi jinnhaan nu meri hustle pata
Ohna baad udd ke aaya
Eh jaa ke Canada shukarde
Main othon hi mud ke aaya

Oh, ajj vi topic talk da Sidhu
Vich mehfal de ni, haan diye

Tu jinnhaan naa' compare kare
Saade level de nahi, haan diye
Jinnhaan naa' compare kare
Saade level de nahi, haan diye

Levels to this shit
There's levels to this shit
And then I bought my whip
There's levels to this shit

(This Kidd ain't gonna run)
(Tu jinnhaan naa' compare kare)
(Saade level de nahi, haan diye)
(There's levels to this shit)
