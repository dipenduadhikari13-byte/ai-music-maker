Show Mxrci on it, ha-ha-ah!
Aye, Sidhu Moose Wala
Dra, whoo, yeah

Jatta ve jatta kivein ae? Ki kardaen club 'ch?
Kadon aaya jail 'chon? 'Te hun kehde jabb 'ch?
Lagda aen ajj vi kise na kise maarde
Ki ae tere dil 'ch? 'Te ki ae tere dabb 'ch?

Ho, tedha-tedha jhaak na, mind kar akkh noon
Maar na hulaare, control kar lakk noon
Cheel'aan wangoon nochda main bhavein dead body'aan
Par jinda jism'aan di bhukh naiyon es jatt noon

Ho, vair ae dimaag 'ch, 'te dili mere dhokha ae
Bach ja tu bach ja, ni tere kole mauka ae
Kyun paer nappe kaal di ki phirdi ae bhaaldi?
Niri poori maut utton geda tera chautha aa

Dass de koi hall ve
Basson baahar gall ve
Thoda jeha side te
Tu mere naal chall ve
Rann eh sambhni
Landuan de vass na
Dulli phiran tere 'te
Tu paa de mainu thall ve

Life ajj-kal ve
Bharosa ki ae saali da
Dekh tainu samajhke
Veham naiyon paalida
Ho, kad-kaath dekh ke
Malwe de jatt da
Ve looh kanda khada hoi janda
Majhe aali da

See, he had a plan (plan, plan)
Yeah, look!
See, he had a plan
I bought the van and squeeze on a trigger

As fast he can
Make sure it don't jam
And he'll get the band
He'll bring the money right back to his fam

This is on you, it's not on me
It's in your hands, do you understand?
Don't get nervous, just stay focused
Aim at his dome, we 've been where he stands

All of these bitches is just a distraction
All of these - all of these fashion
All of these love and all of this madness
All of these guns and all of these action

Damn! All of this drilling and all of this trap
And all of the bodies that's droppin' and hittin' the floor
Woah, just so tragic, fuckin' up rather do this on my own
I'm by myself stop hittin' my phone

I realized a lot and now that I'm grown
I don't need nothing, I'll do this alone
Yeah, how can I tell if that was my dog
If he's moving shiesty (shiesty), if she was a hoe

Then how can I trust her when she say she wifey (wifey)
Stop playin' these games
'Cause out in these streets, this shit could get pricey
Could cost you your life, so don't take that lightly

Ho nehde-nehde lagg na
Reh maithon gap 'te
Bhaalna main labbhna ni
Insta Snap 'te
Dalla ikk maarna
Ajj tere saahamne
Tu aithe aai aan chill 'te
Te jatt ae trap 'te
Glock meri lap 'te
'Te thirty da clip ae

Akkh jama khadi ae
'Te shooter drip ae (ha, ha, ha)
Bhannke main tappjoon
Tu chehra mera bhull jin
Bahar bina number ton
Khadi meri whip ae
Te vairi mera RIP ae

R-I-P, motherfucker! (Whoo!)
Dra!
