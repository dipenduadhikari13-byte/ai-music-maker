I loved you
I loved you
I loved you

Just another day of not being in your way
So I'm all alone
All alone, ooh, oh yeah
Just another week, we don't hardly speak
But I'm holding on
Stop treating me so wrong

Give me your loving, give me your mind
Give me your kissing, give me some time
'Cause I can't live a lie, if my heart walks out your life
Give me your loving, give me some easin'
Give me your kissing, give me a reason
To make me wanna stay
Wanna go back to the day I loved you

I loved you more when you had no money
More, used to say I loved you more
Baby all I need is more time and more mind
I loved you more, everyday was sunny
More, used to think about you more
Baby all I need is more time and more mind

Don't make me twist your arm to stay
A little me will be okay
Walk out the door, ooh
I think it's time I found that guy
I can rely on day and night
Be by my side baby, and be a real man to his lady

Give me your lovin', give me your mind
Give me your kissin', give me some time
'Cause I can't live a lie if my heart walks out your life
Give me your lovin', give me some easin'
Give me your kissin', give me a reason
To make me wanna stay
Wanna go back to the day I loved you

More when you had no money
More, used to say I loved you more
Baby all I need is more time and more mind
I loved you more, everyday was sunny
More, used to think about you more
Baby all I need is more time and more mind

I could walk away, turn my back
But I can't do that, oh
No I can't do that
I loved you more than just what's in the bank
And that's a fact
And that's a fact

Let it go
When you'll be home, give me your heart
Give me your soul
Oh like it used to be
You used to make me happy

Give it up, give me your trust
Give me your passion, give me your love
To make me wanna stay
I wanna go back to the day I loved you

More when you had no money
More, used to say I loved you more
Baby all I need is more time and more mind
I loved you more, everyday was sunny
More, used to think about you more
Baby all I need is more time and more mind

I loved you more when you had no money
More, used to say I loved you more
Baby all I need is more time and more mind
I loved you more, everyday was sunny
More, used to think about you more
Baby all I need is more time and more mind
