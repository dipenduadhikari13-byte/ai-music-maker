Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
- Turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lot of '42 on the flights I'm takin'

Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lot of fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
- Turned they back on me for no good reason

Never had a lot, this is all I need
Lost individuals is all I see
Grab the top spot like, "Pardon my reach"
Woke up one day and it was all on me
If it comes down, it's gon' fall on me
Lot of '42 on the flights I'm takin'
Long way down from the heights I'm chasin'
Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas

Girls checkin' in 'cause my lifestyle dangerous
Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper
Turnin' off my phone for the night now, baby
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Some of my - don't love me
We should sit down before - turns ugly
We should sit down since you said things about me

Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
- Turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lot of '42 on the flights I'm takin'

Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lot of fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
- Turned they back on me for no good reason

- Wanted to kill me and y'all still with 'em
-, Y'all chill with 'em, and y'all wonder why we not friends?
Best thing I can do is not build with you
When I could destroy you, that takes some - discipline
I could send a team to come drill you
I got a billion or two and I know where the - you live
- Gotta chill with talking gangsta
You should just thank us, humble yourselves a little bit

This ain't the same Shawn that you knew once
I don't shine shoes, uh, this ain't what you want, no
All that back and forth on the internet
-, We don't tennis that, y'all gotta do something, yeah
Only thing we 'spect now is violence
Anything besides this, we playing violins, uh
I'm public enemy
- Wanted to kill me and y'all want me to be friendly
- Want sympathy after they wanted to end me

Be those closest to it be the very ones that envy
Shout out to the family
I don't want no friends no more, not many understand me
Everybody want something
You know the price of everything but the value of nothing
But everybody want something
You know the price of everything but the value of nothing

Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
- Turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lot of '42 on the flights I'm takin'

Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lot of fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
- Turned they back on me for no good reason
