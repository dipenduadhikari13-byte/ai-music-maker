Title:  What In The World (feat. NATURE)
Artist: Armaan Malik
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

Waking up today and it's so different
Like I woke up on the wrong side of the planet
I think it's begging us all for some distance, mm
So I think we all gotta just take a minute

[Pre-Chorus]
Take some time
Self reflect, spend some time with ourselves
Slow it down
In this town and inside of our heads

[Chorus]
What in the world is going on?
We need to stop and start again
Humans and animals crying it out
We're holding on by a thread
We gotta change our ways, we gotta make amends
We can do it together, let's resеt
What in the world is going on?
We need to stop and start again

[Verse 2]
Every day is a nеw beginning
A better life yet in the making
One by one, we can make a difference, mm
It's in our hands, now we gotta save it

[Pre-Chorus]
Take some time
Self reflect, spend some time with ourselves
Slow it down
In this town and inside of our heads

[Chorus]
What in the world is going on?
We need to stop and start again
Humans and animals crying it out
We're holding on by a thread
We gotta change our ways, we gotta make amends
We can do it together, let's reset
What in the world is going on?
We need to stop and start again

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
We can do it with love
We can do it with trust
Oh, you and me
We will rise above
We can do it with love
Oh, you and me will rise above

[Outro]
What in the world is going on?
We need to stop and start again
